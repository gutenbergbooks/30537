<p>
Dear Children:
</p><p>
You will remember that, in the front part of Glinda of Oz, the Publishers told
you that when Mr. Baum went away from this world he left behind some
unfinished notes about the Princess Ozma and Dorothy and the jolly people of
the Wonderful Land of Oz. The Publishers promised that they would try to put
these notes together into a new Oz book for you.
</p><p>
Well, here it is&mdash;The Royal Book of Oz.
</p><p>
I am sure that Mr. Baum would be pleased that Ruth Plumly Thompson, who has
known and loved the Oz Stories ever since she was a little girl, has made this
new Oz story, with all the Oz folks in it and true to life.
</p><p>
You see I am Mrs. Baum, the wife of the Royal Historian of Oz, and so I know
how he feels about everything.
</p><p>
Now, about the story:
</p><p>
Of course, we all knew the Scarecrow was a very fine fellow, but surely we
never guessed he ascended from an emperor. Most of us descend from our
ancestors, but the Scarecrow really ASCENDED.
</p><p>
The Scarecrow had a most exciting and adventurous time on the Silver Isle and
Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion just ran out of one adventure into another
trying to rescue him. They made some charming new friends in their
travels&mdash;Sir Hokus of Pokes, the Doubtful Dromedary, and the Comfortable Camel. You'll
find them very unusual and likable. They have the same peculiar, delightful
and informal natures that we love in all the queer Oz people.
</p><p>
Of course every one of us is happy that John R. Neill has drawn the funny and
lovely pictures for the new book. Mr. Neill surely is the Royal Painter of Oz.
</p><p>
This note is intended for all the children of America, who knew and loved Mr.
Baum, and it goes to each of you with his love and mine.

<h3>PROFESSOR WOGGLEBUG'S GREAT IDEA</h3>



<p>"The very thing!" exclaimed Professor Wogglebug, bounding into the air and
upsetting his gold inkwell. "The very next idea!"
</p><p>
"Who&mdash;me?" A round-faced little Munchkin boy stuck his head in the door and
regarded Professor Wogglebug solemnly. He was working his way through the
Professor's Athletic college, and one of his duties was to wait upon this
eminent educator of Oz.
</p><p>
"Certainly not!" snapped Professor Wogglebug. "You're a nobody or a nothing.
Stop gaping and fetch me my hat. I'm off to the Emerald City. And mind the
pupils take their history pills regularly while I'm gone," he added,
clapping his tall hat Zif held out to him on the back of his head.
</p><p>
"Yes, sir!" said the little Munchkin respectfully.
</p><p>
"Don't hurry back, sir!" This last remark the Professor did not hear, for he
was already half way down the college steps.
</p><p>
"Ozma will be delighted with the idea. How clever I am!" he murmured,
twirling his antennae and walking rapidly down the pleasant blue lane.
</p><p>
The Professor, whose College of Art and Athletic Perfection is in the
southwestern part of the Munchkin country, is the biggest bug in Oz, or in
anyplace else, for that matter. He has made education painless by
substituting school pills for books. His students take Latin, history and
spelling pills; they swallow knowledge of every kind with ease and pleasure
and spend the rest of their time in sport. No wonder he is so well thought
of in Oz! No wonder he thinks so well of himself!
</p><p>
Swinging his cane jauntily, the Professor hurried toward the yellow brick road
that leads to the Emerald City, and by nightfall had reached the lovely
capital of Oz.
</p><p>
Oz!&mdash;that marvelous country where no one grows old&mdash;where animals and
birds talk as sensibly as people, and adventures happen every day. Indeed, of
all fairylands in the world, Oz is the most delightful, and of all fairy
cities, the Emerald City is the most beautiful. A soft green light shone for
miles about, and the gemmed turrets and spires of the palace flashed more
brightly than the stars. But its loveliness was familiar to Professor
Wogglebug, and without a pause he proceeded to Ozma's palace and was at
once admitted to the great hall.
</p><p>
A roar of merriment greeted his ears. Ozma, the lovely girl ruler of Oz, was
having a party, and the room was full of most surprising people&mdash;surprising
to some, that is, but old friends to most of us.
</p><p>
Jack, holding tightly to his pumpkin head, was running as fast as his wooden
feet and wobbly legs would take him from Dorothy. A game of blind-man's-buff
was in full swing, and Scraps and Tik-Tok, the Scarecrow and Nick
Chopper, the Glass Cat and the Cowardly Lion, the Wizard of Oz and the
wooden Sawhorse, Cap'n Bill and Betsy Bobbin, Billina and the Hungry Tiger
were tumbling over each other in an effort to keep away from the
blindfolded little girl.
</p><p>
But Dorothy was too quick for them. With a sudden whirl, she spun 'round
and grasped a coatsleeve.
</p><p>
"The Scarecrow!" she laughed triumphantly. "I can tell by the way he
skwoshes&mdash;and now <i>he's</i> it!"
</p><p>
"I'm always <i>it!"</i> chuckled the droll person. "But&mdash;hah! Behold the
learned Professor standing so aloofly in our midst."
</p><p>
No one had noticed Professor Wogglebug, who had been quietly watching the
game.
</p><p>
"I don't like to interrupt the party," he began, approaching Ozma's
throne apologetically, "but I've just had a most brilliant idea!"
</p><p>
"What? Another?" murmured the Scarecrow, rolling up his eyes.
</p><p>
"Where did you lose it?" asked Jack Pumpkinhead, edging forward anxiously.
</p><p>
"Lose it! Who said I'd lost it?" snapped the Professor, glaring at poor
Jack.
</p><p>
"Well, you said you'd had it, and had is the past tense, so&mdash;" Jack's
voice trailed off uncertainly, and Ozma, seeing he was embarrassed, begged
the Professor to explain.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/17.jpg" alt="Jack Pumpkinhead">
<p>
"Your Highness!" began Professor Wogglebug, while the company settled down
in a resigned circle on the floor, "As Oz is the most interesting and
delightful country on the Continent of Imagination and its people the most
unusual and talented, I am about to compile a Royal Book which will give
the names and history of all our people. In other words, I am to be the
Great, Grand Genealogist of Oz!"
</p><p>
"Whatever that is," the Scarecrow whispered in Dorothy's ear.
</p><p>
"And," the Professor frowned severely on the Scarecrow, "with your Majesty's
permission, I shall start at once!"
</p><p>
"Please do," said the Scarecrow with a wave toward the door, "and we will go
on with the party!"
</p><p>
Scraps, the Patchwork Girl, who had been staring fixedly at the Professor
with her silver suspender-button eyes, now sprang to her feet:
</p><p class="poetry">
    "What is a genealogist?<br>
    It's something no one here has missed;<br>
    What puts such notions in your head?<br>
    Turn out your toes&mdash;or go to bed!"
</p><p>
she shouted gaily, then, catching Ozma's disapproving glance, fell over
backwards.
</p><p>
"I don't understand it at all," said Jack Pumpkinhead in a depressed voice.
"I'm afraid my head's too ripe."
</p><p>
"Nor I," said Tik-Tok, the copper clockwork man. "Please wind me up a
lit-tle tight-er Dor-o-thy, I want to think!"
</p><p>
Dorothy obligingly took a key suspended from a hook on his back and wound
him up under his left arm. Everybody began to talk at once, and what with
the Cowardly Lion's deep growl and Tik-Tok's squeaky voice and all the rest
of the tin and meat and wooden voices, the confusion was terrible.
</p><p>
"Wait!" cried Ozma, clapping her hands.
</p><p>
Immediately the room grew so still that one could hear Tik-Tok's machinery
whirring 'round.
</p><p>
"Now!" said Ozma, "One at a time, please, and let us hear from the Scarecrow
first."
</p><p>
The Scarecrow rose. "I think, your Highness," he said modestly, "that anyone
who has studied his Geozify already knows who we are and&mdash;"
</p><p>
"Who you are?" broke in the Wogglebug scornfully&mdash;"Of course they do&mdash;but
<i>I</i> shall tell them who you <i>were!"</i>
</p><p>
"Who I were?" gasped the Scarecrow in a dazed voice, raising his cotton
glove to his forehead. "Who I were? Well, who were I?"
</p><p>
"That's just the point," said Professor Wogglebug. "Who were you? Who were
your ancestors? Where is your family? Where is your family tree? From what
did you descend?"
</p><p>
At each question, the Scarecrow looked more embarrassed. He repeated the
last one several times.
</p><p>
"From what did I descend? From what did I descend? Why, from a bean pole!"
he cried.
</p><p>
This was perfectly true, for Dorothy, a little girl blown by a Kansas
cyclone to the Kingdom of Oz, had discovered the Scarecrow in a farmer's
cornfield and had lifted him down from his pole. Together they had made the
journey to the Emerald City, where the Wizard of Oz had fitted him out with
a fine set of brains. At one time, he had ruled Oz and was generally
considered its cleverest citizen.
</p><p>
Before he could reply further, the Patchwork Girl, who was simply
irrepressible, burst out:
</p><p class="poetry">
    "An ex-straw-ordinary man is he!<br>
    A bean pole for his family tree,<br>
    A Cornishman, upon my soul,<br>
    Descended from a tall, thin Pole!"
</p><p>
"Nonsense!" said Professor Wogglebug sharply, "Being stuffed with straw may
make him extraordinary, but it is quite plain that the Scarecrow was nobody
before he was himself. He has no ancestors, no family; only a bean pole for
a family tree, and is therefore entitled to the merest mention in the Royal
Book of Oz!"
</p><p>
"How about my brains?" asked the Scarecrow in a hurt voice. "Aren't they
enough?"
</p><p>
"Brains have simply nothing to do with royalty!" Professor Wogglebug waved
his fountain pen firmly. "Now&mdash;"
</p><p>
"But see here, wasn't I ruler of Oz?" put in the Scarecrow anxiously.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/21.jpg" alt="Scraps">
</p><p>
"A Ruler but <i>never</i> a royalty!" snapped out the Professor. "Now, if you
will all answer my questions as I call your names, I'll get the necessary
data and be off."
</p><p>
He took out a small memorandum book.
</p><p>
"Your Highness," he bowed to Ozma, "need not bother. I have already entered
your name at the head of the list. Being descended as you are from a long line
of fairies, your family tree is the oldest and most illustrious in Oz."
</p><p>
"Princess Dorothy!"
</p><p>
At the sound of her name, the little girl stood up.
</p><p>
"I know you are from Kansas and were created a Princess of Oz by our
gracious Ruler, but can you tell me anything of your ancestors in America?"
demanded the Professor, staring over the top of his thick glasses.
</p><p>
"You'll have to ask Uncle Henry and Aunt Em," said Dorothy rather sulkily.
The Professor had hurt the feelings of her best friend, the Scarecrow, and
ancestors did not interest her one little bit.
</p><p>
"Very well," said the Professor, writing industriously in his book. "I'll
just enter you as 'Dorothy, Princess of Oz and sixth cousin to a
President!'"
</p><p>
"I'm not!" Dorothy shook her head positively.
</p><p>
"Oh, everyone in America can claim that!" said the Professor easily.
</p><p>
"Nick Chopper!"
</p><p>
Now up rose our old friend the Tin Woodman, who had also been discovered by
Dorothy on her first trip to the Fairyland of Oz.
</p><p>
"You were a man of meat at one time and a woodman by trade?" queried
Professor Wogglebug, poising his pen in the air.
</p><p>
"I am a Tin Woodman, and you may enter me in your book under the name of
Smith, for a tin Smith made me, and as Royal Emperor of the Winkies, I do
not care to go back to my meat connections," said the Tin Woodman in a
dignified voice.
</p><p>
The company applauded, and the Cowardly Lion thumped the floor with his tail.
</p><p>
"Smith is a very good name. I can work up a whole chapter on that," smiled the
Professor. The Tin Woodman <i>had</i> once been a regular person, but a wicked witch
enchanted his ax, and first it chopped off one leg, then the other, and next
both arms and his head. After each accident, Nick went to a tinsmith for
repairs, and finally was entirely made of tin. Nowhere but in Oz could such a
thing happen. But no one can be killed in this marvelous country, and Nick,
with his tin body, went gaily on living and was considered so distinguished
that the Winkies had begged him to be their Emperor.
</p><p>
"Scraps!" called the Professor as Nick sat stiffly down beside Dorothy.
</p><p>
The Patchwork Girl pirouetted madly to the front. Putting one finger in her
mouth, she sang:
</p><p class="poetry">
    "I'm made of patches, as you see.<br>
    A clothes tree is my family tree<br>
    But, pshaw! It's all the same to me!"
</p><p>
A clothes tree? Even Professor Wogglebug grinned. Who could help laughing at
Scraps? Made of odd pieces of goods and brought to life by the powder of
life, the comical girl was the jolliest person imaginable.
</p><p>
"Put me down as a man of me-tal!" drawled Tik-Tok the copper man as the
laugh following Scraps' rhyme had subsided. Tik-Tok was still another of
Dorothy's discoveries, and this marvelous machine man, guaranteed to last a
thousand years, could think, walk, and talk when properly wound.
</p><p>
The Cowardly Lion was entered as a King in his own right. One after the
other, the celebrities of Oz came forward to answer Professor Wogglebug's
questions. The Professor wrote rapidly in his little book. Ozma listened
attentively to each one, and they all seemed interested except the
Scarecrow. Slumped down beside Dorothy, he stared morosely at the ceiling,
his jolly face all wrinkled down on one side.
</p><p>
"If I only knew who I were!" he muttered over and over. "I must think!"
</p><p>
"Don't you mind." Dorothy patted his shoulder kindly. "Royalties are out of
date, and I'll bet the Professor's family tree was a milkweed!"
</p><p>
But the Scarecrow refused to be comforted, and long after the company had
retired he sat hunched sadly in his corner.
</p><p>
"I'll do it! I'll do it!" he exclaimed at last, rising unsteadily to his feet.
Jellia Jamb, Ozma's little waiting maid, returning somewhat later to fetch a
handkerchief her mistress had dropped, was surprised to see him running
through the long hall.
</p><p>
"Why, where are you going?" asked Jellia.
</p><p>
"To find my family tree!" said the Scarecrow darkly, and drawing himself up
to his full height, he fell through the doorway.
</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="images/27.jpg" alt="Chapter Two"></p>
<h2><a name="2">CHAPTER 2</a></h2>
<h3>THE SCARECROW'S FAMILY TREE</h3>
<p>The moon shone brightly, but everyone in the Emerald City was fast asleep!
Through the deserted streets hurried the Scarecrow. For the first time
since his discovery by little Dorothy, he was really unhappy. Living as he
did in a Fairyland, he had taken many things for granted and had rather
prided himself on his unusual appearance. Indeed, not until Professor
Wogglebug's rude remarks concerning his family had he given his past a
thought.
</p><p>
"I am the only person in Oz without a family!" he reflected sorrowfully.
"Even the Cowardly Lion has kingly parents and a palm tree! But I must keep
thinking. My brains have never failed me yet. Who was I? Who were I? Who
were I?"
</p><p>
Often he thought so hard that he forgot to look where he was going and ran
headlong into fences, stumbled down gutters, and over stiles. But fortunately,
the dear fellow could not hurt himself, and he would struggle up, pat his
straw into shape, and walk straightway into something else. He made good time
in between falls, however, and was soon well on his way down the yellow brick
road that ran through the Munchkin Country. For he had determined to return to
the Munchkin farm where Dorothy had first discovered him and try to find some
traces of his family.
</p><p>
Now being stuffed with straw had many advantages, for requiring neither food
nor sleep the Scarecrow could travel night and day without interruption.
The stars winked out one by one, and by the time the cocks of the Munchkin
farmers began to crow, he had come to the banks of a broad blue river!
</p><p>
The Scarecrow took off his hat and scratched his head thoughtfully. Crossing
rivers is no easy matter in Oz, for there isn't a ferry in the Kingdom, and
unless one is a good swimmer or equipped with some of the Wizard's magic it
is mighty troublesome. Water does not agree with the Scarecrow at all, and
as for swimming, he can no more swim than a bag of meal.
</p><p>
But he was too wise a person to give up merely because a thing appeared to
be impossible. It was for just such emergencies that his excellent brains
had been given to him.
</p><p>
"If Nick Chopper were here, he would build a raft in no time," murmured the
Scarecrow, "but as he is not, I must think of another way!"
</p><p>
Turning his back on the river, which distracted his mind, he began to think
with all his might. Before he could collect his thoughts, there was a
tremendous crash, and next minute he was lying face down in the mud.
Several little crashes followed, and a shower of water. Then a wet voice
called out with a cheerful chuckle:
</p><p>
"Come on out, my dear Rattles. Not a bad place at all, and here's breakfast
already waiting!"
</p><p>
"Breakfast!" The Scarecrow turned over cautiously. A huge and curious
creature was slashing through the grass toward him. A smaller and still
more curious one followed. Both were extremely damp and had evidently just
come out of the river.
</p><p>
"Good morning!" quavered the Scarecrow, sitting up with a jerk and at the same
time reaching for a stick that lay just behind him.
</p><p>
"I won't eat it if it talks&mdash;so there!" The smaller creature stopped and
stared fixedly at the Scarecrow.
</p><p>
The Scarecrow, hearing this, tried to think of something else to say, but the
appearance of the two was so amazing that, as he told Dorothy afterwards, he
was struck dumb. The larger was at least two hundred feet long and made
entirely of blocks of wood. On each block was a letter of the alphabet. The
head was a huge square block with a serpent's face and long, curling,
tape-measure tongue. The little one was very much smaller and seemed to consist of
hundreds of rattles, wood, celluloid, and rubber, fastened together with
wires. Every time it moved, the rattles tinkled. Its face, however, was not
unpleasant, so the Scarecrow took heart and made a deep bow.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/31.jpg" alt="The Scarecrow speaks with the A-B-Sea Serpent"></p>
<p>
"And I'm not going to eat anything that squirms." This time it was the big
serpent who spoke.
</p><p>
"Thank you!" said the Scarecrow, bowing several times more. "You relieve my
mind. I've never been a breakfast yet, and I'd rather not begin. But if I
cannot be your breakfast, let me be your friend!" He extended his arms
impulsively.
</p><p>
There was something so jolly about the Scarecrow's smile that
the two creatures became friendly at once, and moreover told him the story
of their lives.
</p><p>
"As you have doubtless noted," began the larger creature, "I am an A-B-Sea
Serpent. I am employed in the nursery of the Mer children to teach them their
letters. My friend, here, is a Rattlesnake, and it is his business to amuse
the Mer babies while the Mermaids are mer-marketing. Once a year, we take a
vacation, and proceeding from the sea depths up a strange river, we came out
upon this shore. Perhaps you, Sir, will be able to tell us where we are?"
</p><p>
"You are in the Munchkin Country of the Land of Oz," explained the Scarecrow
politely. "It is a charming place for a vacation. I would show you about
myself if I were not bound on an important mission." Here the Scarecrow
sighed deeply.
</p><p>
"Have you a family?" he asked the A-B-Sea Serpent curiously.
</p><p>
"Yes, indeed," replied the monster, snapping its tape-measure tongue in and
out, "I have five great-grandmothers, twenty-one grandnieces, seven
brothers, and six sisters-in-law!"
</p><p>
"Ah!" murmured the Scarecrow, clasping his hands tragically, "How I envy
you. I have no one&mdash;no aunts&mdash;no ancestors&mdash;no family&mdash;no family tree
but a bean pole. I am, alas, a man without a <i>past!"</i> The Scarecrow
looked so dejected that the Rattlesnake thought he was going to cry.
</p><p>
"Oh, cheer up!" it begged in a distressed voice. "Think of your
<i>presence</i>&mdash;here&mdash;I give you permission to shake me!" The
Scarecrow was so affected by this kind offer that he cheered up immediately.
</p><p>
"No past but a presence&mdash;I'll remember that!" He swelled out his straw chest
complacently, and leaning over, stroked the Rattlesnake on the head.
</p><p>
"Are you good at riddles?" asked the Rattlesnake timidly.
</p><p>
"Well," answered the Scarecrow judiciously, "I have very good brains, given
me by the famous Wizard of Oz."
</p><p>
"Then why is the A-B-Sea Serpent like a city?" asked the Rattlesnake promptly.
</p><p>
The Scarecrow thought hard for several seconds.
</p><p>
"Because it is made up of blocks!" he roared triumphantly. "That's easy; now
it's my turn. Why is the A-B-Sea Serpent such a slow talker?"
</p><p>
"Give it up!" said the Rattlesnake after shaking himself several times.
</p><p>
"Because his tongue is a tape measure, and he has to measure his words!"
cried the Scarecrow, snapping his clumsy fingers. "And that's a good one,
if I did make it myself. I must remember to tell it to Dorothy!"
</p><p>
Then he sobered quite suddenly, for the thought of Dorothy brought back the
purpose of his journey. Interrupting the Rattlesnake in the midst of a new
riddle, he explained how anxious he was to return to the little farm where he
had been discovered and try to find some traces of his family.
</p><p>
"And the real riddle," he sighed with a wave of his hand, "is how to cross
this river."
</p><p>
"That's easy and no riddle at all," rumbled the A-B-Sea Serpent, who had
been listening attentively to the Scarecrow's remarks. "I'll stretch
across, and you can walk over." Suiting the action to the word, he began
backing very cautiously toward the river so as not to shake the Scarecrow
off his feet.
</p><p>
"Mind your P's and Q's!" called the Rattlesnake warningly. It was well that
he spoke, for the A-B-Sea Serpent had doubled the P and Q blocks under, and
they were ready to snap off. Finally, however, he managed to make a bridge
of himself, and the Scarecrow stepped easily over the blocks, the huge
serpent holding himself rigid. Just as he reached Y, the unfortunate
creature sneezed, and all the blocks rattled together. Up flew the
Scarecrow and escaped falling into the stream only by the narrowest margin.
</p><p align="center"><img src="images/34.jpg" alt="The A-B-C Serpent">
</p><p>
"Blockhead!" shrilled the Rattlesnake, who had taken a great fancy to the
Scarecrow.
</p><p>
"I'm all right," cried the Scarecrow rather breathlessly. "Thank you very
much!" He sprang nimbly up the bank. "Hope you have a pleasant vacation!"
</p><p>
"Can't, with a rattlepate like that." The A-B-Sea Serpent nodded glumly in
the Rattlesnake's direction.
</p><p>
"Now don't quarrel," begged the Scarecrow. "You are both charming and
unusual, and if you follow that Yellow Road, you will come to the Emerald
City, and Ozma will be delighted to welcome you."
</p><p>
"The Emerald City! We must see that, my dear Rattles." Forgetting his
momentary displeasure, the A-B-Sea Serpent pulled himself out of the river,
and waving his X Y Z blocks in farewell to the Scarecrow, went
clattering down the road, the little Rattlesnake rattling along behind him.
</p><p>
As for the Scarecrow, he continued his journey, and the day was so
delightful and the country so pleasant that he almost forgot he had no
family. He was treated everywhere with the greatest courtesy and had
innumerable invitations from the hospitable Munchkins. He was anxious to
reach his destination, however, so he refused them all, and traveling night
and day came without further mishap or adventure late on the second evening
to the little Munchkin farm where Dorothy had first discovered him. He was
curious to know whether the pole on which he had been hoisted to scare away
the crows still stood in the cornfield and whether the farmer who had made
him could tell him anything further about his history.
</p><p>
"It is a shame to waken him," thought the kind Scarecrow. "I'll just take a
look in the cornfield." The moon shone so brightly that he had no trouble
finding his way about. With a little cry of pleasure, he pushed his way
through the dry cornstalks. There in the center of the field stood a tall
pole&mdash;the very identical bean pole from which he had descended.
</p><p>
"All the family or family tree I've got!" cried the Scarecrow, running toward
it with emotion.
</p><p>
"What's that?" A window in the farmhouse was thrown up, and a sleepy
Munchkin thrust out his head. "What are you doing?" he called crossly.
</p><p>
"Thinking!" said the Scarecrow, leaning heavily against the bean pole.
</p><p>
"Well, don't do it out loud," snapped the farmer. Then, catching a better
view of the Scarecrow, he cried in surprise: "Why, it's you!&mdash;Come right in,
my dear fellow, and give us the latest news from the Emerald City. I'll
fetch a candle!"
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/37.jpg" alt="The Scarecrow thinks"></p>
<p>
The farmer was very proud of the Scarecrow. He had made him long ago by
stuffing one of his old suits with straw, painting a jolly face on a sack,
stuffing that, and fastening the two together. Red boots, a hat, and yellow
gloves had finished his man&mdash;and nothing could have been jollier than the
result. Later on, when the Scarecrow had run off with Dorothy and got his
brains from the Wizard of Oz and become ruler of the Emerald City, the little
farmer had felt highly gratified.
</p><p>
The Scarecrow, however, was not in a humor for conversation. He wanted to
think in peace. "Don't bother!" he called up. "I'm going to spend the night
here. I'll see you in the morning."
</p><p>
"All right! Take care of yourself," yawned the farmer, and drew in his head.
</p><p>
For a long time the Scarecrow stood perfectly still beside the bean pole&mdash;
thinking. Then he got a spade from the shed and began clearing away the
cornstalks and dried leaves from around the base of the pole. It was slow
work, for his fingers were clumsy, but he persevered. Then a wonderful idea
came to him.
</p><p>
"Perhaps if I dig down a bit, I may discover&mdash;" He got no further, for at the
word "discover," he pushed the spade down with all his might. There was a loud
crash. The bottom dropped out of things, and the Scarecrow fell through.
</p><p>
"Gr-eat cornstalks!" cried the Scarecrow, throwing up his arms. To his surprise,
they came in contact with a stout pole, which he embraced. It was a lifesaver,
for he was shooting down into the darkness at a great rate.
</p><p>
"Why!" he gasped as soon as he regained his breath, for he was falling at a
terrific rate of speed, "Why, I believe I'm sliding down the <i>bean pole!"</i>
</p>

<h2><a name="3">CHAPTER 3</a></h2>
<h3>DOWN THE MAGIC BEAN POLE</h3>
<p>Hugging the bean pole for dear life, the Scarecrow slid rapidly downward,
Everything was dark, but at times a confused roaring sounded in his ears.
</p><p>
"Father, I hear something falling past!" shouted a gruff voice all at once.
</p><p>
"Then reach out and pull it in," growled a still deeper voice. There was a
flash of light, a door opened suddenly, and a giant hand snatched the air
just above the Scarecrow's head.
</p><p>
"It's a good thing I haven't a heart to fail me," murmured the Scarecrow,
glancing up fearfully and clinging more tightly to the pole. "Though I
fall, I shall not falter. But where under the earth am I falling to?" At
that minute, a door opened far below, and someone called up:
</p><p>
"Who are you? Have out your toll and be ready to salute the Royal Ruler of
the Middlings!"
</p><p>
The Scarecrow had learned in the course of his many and strange adventures
that it was best to accede to every request that was reasonable or possible.
Realizing that unless he answered at once he would fall past his strange
questioners, he shouted amiably:
</p><p>
"I am the Scarecrow of Oz, sliding down my family tree!" The words echoed
oddly in the narrow passageway, and by the time he reached the word "tree" the
Scarecrow could make out two large brown men leaning from a door somewhere
below. Next minute he came to a sharp stop. A board had shot out and closed
off the passageway. So sudden was the stop that the Scarecrow was tossed
violently upward. While he endeavored to regain his balance, the two Middlings
eyed him curiously.
</p><p>
"So this is the kind of thing they grow on top," said one, holding a lantern
close to the Scarecrow's head.
</p><p>
"Toll, Toll!" droned the other, holding out a horribly twisted hand.
</p><p>
"One moment, your Royal Middleness!" cried the Scarecrow, backing as far away
from the lantern as he could, for with a straw stuffing one cannot be too
careful of fire. He felt in his pocket for an emerald he had picked up in the
Emerald City a few days before and handed it gingerly to the Muddy monarch.
</p><p>
"Why do you call me Middleness?" the King demanded angrily, taking the
emerald.
</p><p>
"Is your kingdom not in the middle of the earth, and are you not royalty?
What could be more proper than Royal Middleness?" asked the Scarecrow,
flecking the dust from his hat.
</p><p>
Now that he had a better view, he saw that <i>the two were entirely men of mud,</i>
and very roughly put together. Dried grass hair stood erect upon each head,
and their faces were large and lumpy and had a disconcerting way of changing
shape. Indeed, when the King leaned over to examine the Scarecrow, his
features were so soft they seemed to run into his cheek, which hung down
alarmingly, while his nose turned sideways and lengthened at least an inch!
</p><p>
Muddle pushed the King's nose back and began spreading his cheek into place.
Instead of hands and feet, the Middlings had gnarled and twisted roots
which curled up in a perfectly terrifying manner. Their teeth were gold,
and their eyes shone like small electric lights. They wore stiff coats of
dried mud, buttoned clumsily with lumps of coal, and the King had a tall
mud crown. Altogether, the Scarecrow thought he had never seen more
disagreeable looking creatures.
</p><p>
"What he needs," spluttered the King, fingering the jewel greedily, "is a
coat of mud! Shall we pull him in, Muddle?"
</p><p>
"He's very poorly made, your Mudjesty. Can you work, Carescrow?" asked
Muddle, thumping him rudely in the chest.
</p><p>
"Scarecrow, if you please!" The Scarecrow drew himself up and spoke with
great difficulty. "I can work with my head!" he added proudly.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/45.jpg" alt="The Middlings"></p>
<p>
"Your head!" roared the King. "Did you hear that, Muddle? He works with his
head. What's the matter with your hands?" Again the King lunged forward, and
this time his face fell on the other side and had bulged enormously before
Muddle could pat it into shape. They began whispering excitedly together, but
the Scarecrow made no reply, for looking over their shoulder he glimpsed a
dark, forbidding cavern lighted only by the flashing red eyes of thousands of
Middlings. They appeared to be digging, and above the rattle of the shovels
and picks came the hoarse voice of one of them singing the Middling National
Air. Or so the Scarecrow gathered from the words:
</p><p class="poetry">
    "Oh, chop the brown clods as they fall with a thud!<br>
    Three croaks for the Middlings, who stick in the Mud.<br>
    Oh, mud, rich and wormy! Oh, mud, sweet and squirmy!<br>
    Oh what is so lovely as Mud! Oh what is so lovely as Mud!<br>
    Three croaks for the Middlings, who delve all the day<br>
    In their beautiful Kingdom of soft mud and clay!"
</p><p>
The croaks that came at the end of the song were so terrifying that the
Scarecrow shivered in spite of himself.
</p><p>
"Ugh! Hardly a place for a pleasant visit!" he gasped, flattening himself
against the wall of the passage. Feeling that matters had gone far enough, he
repeated in a loud voice:
</p><p>
"I am the Scarecrow of Oz and desire to continue my fall. I have paid my toll
and unless your Royal Middleness release me&mdash;"
</p><p>
"Might as well drop him&mdash;a useless creature!" whispered Muddle, and
before the King had time to object, he jerked the board back. "Fall on!" he
screeched maliciously, and the Scarecrow shot down into the darkness, the
hoarse screams of the two Middlings echoing after him through the gloom.
</p><p>
No use trying to think! The poor Scarecrow bumped and banged from side to side
of the passage. It was all he could do to keep hold of the bean pole, so
swiftly was he falling.
</p><p>
"A good thing I'm not made of meat like little Dorothy," he wheezed
breathlessly. His gloves were getting worn through from friction with the
pole, and the rush of air past his ears was so confusing that he gave up all
idea of thinking. Even magic brains refuse to work under such conditions. Down
&mdash;down&mdash;down he plunged till he lost all count of time.
Down&mdash;down&mdash;down&mdash;hours and hours! Would he never stop? Then suddenly it grew quite
light, and he flashed through what appeared to be a hole in the roof of a huge
silver palace, whirled down several stories and landed in a heap on the floor
of a great hall. In one hand he clutched a small fan, and in the other a
parasol that had snapped off the beanstalk just before he reached the palace
roof.
</p><p>
Shaken and bent over double though he was, the Scarecrow could see that he
had fallen into a company of great magnificence. He had a confused glimpse
of silken clad courtiers, embroidered screens, inlaid floors, and flashing
silver lanterns, when there was a thundering bang that hurled him halfway to
the roof again. Falling to a sitting position and still clinging to the bean
pole, he saw two giant kettle drums nearby, still vibrating from the terrible
blows they had received.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/48.jpg" alt="The Scarecrow crash-lands">
<p>
The company were staring at him solemnly, and as he attempted to rise, they
fell prostrate on their faces. Up flew the poor flimsy Scarecrow again, such
was the draught, and this time landed on his face. He was beginning to feel
terribly annoyed, but before he could open his mouth or stand up, a deep voice
boomed:
</p><p>
"He has come!"
</p><p>
"He has come!" shrilled the rest of the company, thumping their heads on the
stone floor. The language seemed strange to the Scarecrow, but oddly enough,
he could understand it perfectly. Keeping a tight grasp on the bean pole, he
gazed at the prostrate assemblage, too astonished to speak. They looked
exactly like the pictures of some Chinamen he had seen in one of Dorothy's
picture books back in Oz, but instead of being yellow, their skin was a
curious gray, and the hair of old and young alike was silver and worn in long,
stiff queues. Before he had time to observe any more, an old, old courtier
hobbled forward and beckoned imperiously to a page at the door. The page
immediately unfurled a huge silk umbrella and, running forward, held it over
the Scarecrow's head.
</p><p>
"Welcome home, sublime and noble Ancestor! Welcome, honorable and exalted
Sir." The old gentleman made several deep salaams.
</p><p align="center"><img src="images/49.jpg" alt="Welcome home, sublime and noble Ancestor!">
</p><p>
"Welcome, immortal and illustrious Ancestor! Welcome, ancient and serene
Father!" cried the others, banging their heads hard on the floor&mdash;so hard
that their queues flew into the air.
</p><p>
"Ancestor! Father!" mumbled the Scarecrow in a puzzled voice. Then,
collecting himself somewhat, he made a deep bow, and sweeping off his hat
with a truly royal gesture began: "I am indeed honored&mdash;" But he got no
farther. The silken clad courtiers sprang to their feet in a frenzy of joy.
A dozen seized him bodily and carried him to a great silver throne room.
</p><p>
"The same beautiful voice!" cried the ancient gentleman, clasping his hands
in an ecstasy of feeling.
</p><p>
"It is he! The Emperor! The Emperor has returned! Long live the Emperor!"
shouted everyone at once. The confusion grew worse and worse.
</p><p>
"Ancestor! Father! Emperor!" The Scarecrow could scarcely believe his ears.
"For a fallen man, I am rising like yeast!" he murmured to himself. Half a
dozen courtiers had run outdoors to spread the wonderful news, and soon
silver gongs and bells began ringing all over the kingdom, and cries of
"The Emperor! The Emperor!" added to the general excitement. Holding fast
to the sides of the throne and still grasping the little fan and parasol,
the Scarecrow sat blinking with embarrassment.
</p><p>
"If they would just stop emperoring, I could ask them who I am," thought the
poor Scarecrow. As if in answer to his thoughts, the tottery old nobleman
raised his long arm, and at once the hall became absolutely silent.
</p><p>
"Now!" sighed the Scarecrow, leaning forward. "Now I shall hear something of
interest."
</p>

<h2><a name="4">CHAPTER 4</a></h2>
<h3>DOROTHY'S LONELY BREAKFAST</h3>
<p>
Dorothy, who occupied one of the coziest apartments in Ozma's palace, wakened
the morning after the party with a feeling of great uneasiness. At breakfast,
the Scarecrow was missing. Although he, the Tin Woodman and Scraps did not
require food, they always livened up the table with their conversation.
Ordinarily Dorothy would have thought nothing of the Scarecrow's absence, but
she could not forget his distressed expression when Professor Wogglebug had so
rudely remarked on his family tree. The Professor himself had left before
breakfast, and everybody but Dorothy had forgotten all about the Royal Book
of Oz.
</p><p>
Already many of Ozma's guests who did not live in the palace were preparing
to depart, but Dorothy could not get over her feeling of uneasiness. The
Scarecrow was her very best friend, and it was not like him to go without
saying goodbye. So she hunted through the gardens and in every room of the
palace and questioned all the servants. Unfortunately, Jellia Jamb, who was
the only one who had seen the Scarecrow go, was with her mistress. Ozma
always breakfasted alone and spent the morning over state matters. Knowing
how busy she was, Dorothy did not like to disturb her. Betsy Bobbin and
Trot, real little girls like Dorothy, also lived in the Fairy palace, and
Ozma was a great chum for them. But the Kingdom of Oz had to be governed in
between times, and they all knew that unless Ozma had the mornings to
herself, she could not play with them in the afternoons. So Dorothy
searched by herself.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/55.jpg" alt="Dorothy searches"></p>
<p>
"Perhaps I didn't look hard enough," thought the little girl, and searched
the palace all over again.
</p><p>
"Don't worry," advised the Tin Woodman, who was playing checkers with
Scraps. "He's probably gone home."
</p><p class="poetry">
    "He is a man of brains; why worry<br>
     Because he's left us in a hurry?"
</p><p>
chuckled Scraps with a careless wave of her hand, and Dorothy, laughing in
spite of herself, ran out to have another look in the garden.
</p><p>
"That is just what he has done, and if I hurry, I may overtake him. Anyway,
I believe I'll go and pay him a visit," thought Dorothy.
</p><p>
Trot and Betsy Bobbin were swinging in one of the royal hammocks, and when
Dorothy invited them to go along, they explained that they were going on a
picnic with the Tin Woodman. So without waiting to ask anyone else or even
whistling for Toto, her little dog, Dorothy skipped out of the garden.
</p><p>
The Cowardly Lion, half asleep under a rose bush, caught a glimpse of her blue
dress flashing by, and bounding to his feet thudded after her.
</p><p>
"Where are you going?" he asked, stifling a giant yawn.
</p><p>
"To visit the Scarecrow," explained Dorothy. "He looked so unhappy last
night. I am afraid he is worrying about his family tree, and I thought
p'raps I could cheer him up."
</p><p>
The Cowardly Lion stretched luxuriously. "I'll go too," he rumbled, giving
himself a shake. "But it's the first time I ever heard of the Scarecrow
worrying."
</p><p>
"But you see," Dorothy said gently, "Professor Wogglebug told him he had no
family."
</p><p>
"Family! Family fiddlesticks! Hasn't he got us?" The Cowardly Lion stopped
and waved his tail indignantly.
</p><p>
"Why, you dear old thing!" Dorothy threw her arms around his neck. "You've
given me a lovely idea!" The Cowardly Lion tried not to look pleased.
</p><p>
"Well, as long as I've given it to you, you might tell me what it is," he
suggested mildly.
</p><p>
"Why," said Dorothy, skipping along happily, "we'll let him adopt us and be
his really relations. I'll be his sister, and you'll be&mdash;"
</p><p>
"His cousin&mdash;that is, if you think he wouldn't mind having a great coward
like me for a cousin," finished the Cowardly Lion in an anxious voice.
</p><p>
"Do you still feel as cowardly as ever?" asked Dorothy sympathetically.
</p><p>
"More so!" sighed the great beast, glancing apprehensively over his
shoulder. This made Dorothy laugh, for although the lion trembled like a
cup custard at the approach of danger, he always managed to fight with
great valor, and the little girl felt safer with him than with the whole
army of Oz, who never were frightened but who always ran away.
</p><p>
Now anyone who is at all familiar with his geozify knows that the Fairyland
of Oz is divided into four parts, exactly like a parchesi board, with the
Emerald City in the very center, the purple Gillikin Country to the north,
the red Quadling Country to the south, the blue Munchkin Country to the
east, and the yellow Country of the Winkies to the west. It was toward the
west that Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion turned their steps, for it was in
the Winkie Country that the Scarecrow had built his gorgeous golden tower
in exactly the shape of a huge ear of corn.
</p><p>
Dorothy ran along beside the Cowardly Lion, chatting over their many
adventures in Oz, and stopping now and then to pick buttercups and daisies
that dotted the roadside. She tied a big bunch to the tip of her friend's tail
and twined some more in his mane, so that he presented a very festive
appearance indeed. Then, when she grew tired, she climbed on his big back, and
swiftly they jogged through the pleasant land of the Winkies. The people waved
to them from windows and fields, for everyone loved little Dorothy and the big
lion, and as they passed a neat yellow cottage, a little Winkie Lady came
running down the path with a cup of tea in one hand and a bucket in the other.
</p><p>
"I saw you coming and thought you might be thirsty," she called hospitably.
Dorothy drank her cup without alighting.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/59.jpg" alt="Dorothy and the Lion"></p>
<p>
"We're in an awful hurry; we're visiting the Scarecrow," she exclaimed
apologetically. The lion drank his bucket of tea at one gulp. It was so hot
that it made his eyes water.
</p><p>
"How I loathe tea! If I hadn't been such a coward, I'd have upset the bucket,"
groaned the lion as the little Winkie Lady went back into her house. "But no,
I was afraid of hurting her feelings. Ugh, what a terrible thing it is to be a
coward!"
</p><p>
"Nonsense!" said Dorothy, wiping her eyes with her handkerchief. "You're not
a coward, you're just polite. But let's run very fast so we can reach the
Scarecrow's in time for lunch."
</p><p>
So like the wind away raced the Cowardly Lion, Dorothy holding fast to his
mane, with her curls blowing straight out behind, and in exactly two Oz
hours and seventeen Winkie minutes they came to the dazzling corn-ear
residence of their old friend. Hurrying through the cornfields that
surrounded his singular mansion, Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion rushed
through the open door.
</p><p>
"We've come for lunch," announced Dorothy.
</p><p>
"And I'm hungry enough to eat crow," rumbled the lion. Then both stopped in
dismay, for the big reception room was empty. From a room above came a
shuffling of feet, and Blink, the Scarecrow's gentlemanly housekeeper, came
running down the stairs.
</p><p>
"Where's the Scarecrow?" asked Dorothy anxiously. "Isn't he here?"
</p><p>
"Here! Isn't he there? Isn't he in the Emerald City?" gasped the little
Winkie, putting his specs on upside down.
</p><p>
"No&mdash;at least, I don't think so. Oh, dear, I just felt that something had
happened to him!" wailed Dorothy, sinking into an ebony armchair and
fanning herself with a silk sofa cushion.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/61.jpg" alt="Blink"></p>
<p>
"Now don't be alarmed." The Cowardly Lion rushed to Dorothy's side and
knocked three vases and a clock off a little table, just to show how calm
he was. "Think of his brains! The Scarecrow has never come to harm yet, and
all we have to do is to return to the Emerald City and look in Ozma's Magic
Picture. Then, when we know where he is, we can go and find him and tell
him about our little adoption plan," he added, looking hopefully at Dorothy.
</p><p>
"The Scarecrow himself couldn't have spoken more sensibly," observed Blink
with a great sigh of relief, and even Dorothy felt better.
</p><p>
In Ozma's palace, as many of you know, there is a Magic Picture, and when
Ozma or Dorothy want to see any of their friends, they have merely to wish
to see them, and instantly the picture shows the person wished for and
exactly what he is doing at that certain time.
</p><p>
"Of course!" sighed Dorothy. "Why didn't I think of it myself?"
</p><p>
"Better have some lunch before you start back," suggested Blink, and
bustling about had soon set out an appetizing repast. Dorothy was too busy
worrying about the Scarecrow to have much appetite, but the Cowardly Lion
swallowed seventeen roasts and a bucket of corn syrup.
</p><p>
"To give me courage!" he explained to Dorothy, licking his chops. "There's
nothing that makes me so cowardly as an empty stomach!"
</p><p>
It was quite late in the afternoon before they could get away. Blink
insisted on putting up a lunch, and it took some time to make enough
sandwiches for the Cowardly Lion. But at last it was ready and packed into
an old hat box belonging to Mops, the Scarecrow's cook. Then Dorothy,
balancing the box carefully on her lap, climbed on the Cowardly Lion's
back, and assuring Blink that they would return in a few days with his
master, they bade him farewell. Blink almost spoiled things by bursting
into tears, but he managed to restrain himself long enough to say goodbye,
and Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion, feeling a little solemn themselves,
started toward the Emerald City.
</p><p>
"My, but it's growing dark," said Dorothy after they had gone several miles.
"I believe it's going to storm."
</p><p>
Scarcely had she finished speaking before there was a terrific crash of
thunder. The Cowardly Lion promptly sat down. Off of his back bounced the
sandwich box and into the sandwich box rolled Dorothy, head first.
</p><p>
"How terribly upsetting," coughed the Cowardly Lion.
</p><p>
"I should say it was!" Dorothy crawled indignantly out of the hat box and
began wiping the butter from her nose. "You've simply ruined the supper!"
</p><p>
"It was my heart," explained the Cowardly Lion sorrowfully. "It jumped so
hard that it upset me, but climb on my back again, and I'll run very fast
to some place of shelter."
</p><p>
"But where are you?" Dorothy asked in real alarm, for it had grown
absolutely dark.
</p><p>
"Here," quavered the Cowardly Lion, and guided by his voice, Dorothy
stumbled over to him and climbed again on his back. One crash of thunder
followed another, and at each crash the Cowardly Lion leapt forward a bit
faster until they fairly flew through the dark.
</p><p>
"It won't take us long to reach the Emerald City at this rate!" called
Dorothy, but the wind tossed the words far behind her, and seeing that
conversation was impossible, she clung fast to the lion's mane and began
thinking about the Scarecrow. The thunder continued at frequent intervals, but
there was no rain, and after they had been running for what seemed to Dorothy
hours and hours, a sudden terrific bump sent her flying over the lion's head
into a bush. Too breathless to speak, she felt herself carefully all over.
Then, finding that she was still in one piece, she called to the Cowardly
Lion. She could hear him moaning and muttering about his heart.
</p><p>
"Any bones broken?" she asked anxiously.
</p><p>
"Only my head," groaned the lion dismally. Just then the darkness lifted as
suddenly as it had fallen, and Dorothy saw him leaning against a tree with
his eyes closed. There was a big bump on his head. With a little cry of
sympathy, Dorothy hurried toward him, when all at once something strange
about their surroundings struck her.
</p><p>
"Why, where are we?" cried the little girl, stopping short. The lion's eyes
flew open, and forgetting all about his bump, he looked around in dismay.
No sign of the Emerald City anywhere. Indeed, they were in a great, dim
forest, and considering the number of trees, it is a wonder that they had
not run into one long ago.
</p><p>
"I must have run the wrong way," faltered the Cowardly Lion in a distressed
voice.
</p><p>
"You couldn't help that; anyone would lose his way in the dark," said Dorothy
generously. "But I wish we hadn't fallen in the sandwiches. I'm hungry!"
</p><p>
"So am I. Do you think anyone lives in this forest, Dorothy?"
</p><p>
Dorothy did not answer, for just then she caught sight of a big sign nailed
to one of the trees.
</p><p>
"Turn to the right," directed the sign.
</p><p>
"Oh, come on!" cried Dorothy, cheering up immediately. "I believe we're
going to have another adventure."
</p><p>
"I'd rather have some supper," sighed the Cowardly Lion wistfully, "but
unless we want to spend the night here, we might as well move along. I'm to
be fed up on adventure, I suppose."
</p><p>
"Turn to the left," advised the next sign, and the two turned obediently and
hurried on, trying to keep a straight course through the trees. In a
Fairyland like Oz, where there are no trains or trolleys or even horses for
traveling ('cepting Ozma's sawhorse), there are bound to be unexplored
portions. And though Dorothy had been at one time or another in almost
every part of Oz, the country through which they were now passing was
totally unfamiliar to her. Night was coming on, and it was growing so dark
that she could hardly read the third sign when they presently came upon it.
</p><p>
"Don't sing," directed the sign sternly.
</p><p>
"Sing!" snapped Dorothy indignantly, "Who wants to sing?"
</p><p>
"We might as well keep to the left," said the Cowardly Lion in a resigned
voice, and they walked along for some time in silence. The trees were
thinning out, and as they came to the edge of the forest, another sign
confronted them.
</p><p>
"Slow down," read Dorothy with great difficulty. "What nonsense! If we slow
down, how shall we ever get anywhere?"
</p><p>
"Wait a minute," mused the Cowardly Lion, half closing his eyes. "Aren't
there two roads just ahead, one going up and one going down? We're to take
the down road, I suppose. 'Slow down,' isn't that what it says?"
</p><p>
Slow down it surely was, for the road was so steep and full of stones that
Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion had to pick their way with utmost care. But
even bad roads must end somewhere, and coming suddenly to the edge of the
woods, they saw a great city lying just below. A dim light burned over the
main gate, and toward this the Cowardly Lion and Dorothy hurried as fast as
they could. This was not very fast, for an unaccountable drowsiness was
stealing over them.
</p><p>
Slowly and more slowly, the tired little girl and her great four-footed
companion advanced toward the dimly lighted gate. They were so drowsy that
they had ceased to talk. But they dragged on.
</p><p>
"Hah, hoh, hum!" yawned the Cowardly Lion. "What makes my feet so heavy?"
</p><p>
He stopped short and examined each of his four feet sleepily.
</p><p>
Dorothy swallowed a yawn and tried to run, but a walk was all she could
manage.
</p><p>
"Hah, hoh, hum!" she gaped, stumbling along with her eyes closed.
</p><p>
By the time they had reached the gate, they were yawning so hard that the
Cowardly Lion had nearly dislocated his jaw, and Dorothy was perfectly
breathless. Holding to the lion's mane to steady herself, Dorothy blinked
up uncertainly at the sign over the gate.
</p><p>
"Hah&mdash;here we are&mdash;Hoh!" She held her hand wearily before her mouth.
</p><p>
Then, with a great effort, she read the words of the sign.
</p><p>
"Um&mdash;Great&mdash;Grand and Mighty Slow Kingdom of Pokes! Uh-hah&mdash;Pokes! Do
you hear? Hah, hoh, hu, uum!"
</p><p>
Dorothy looked about in alarm, despite her sleepiness.
</p><p>
"Do you hear?" she repeated anxiously as no answer came through the gloom.
</p><p>
The Cowardly Lion did not hear. He had fallen down and was fast asleep, and so
in another minute was Dorothy, her head pillowed against his kind,
comfortable, cowardly heart. Fast asleep at the gates of a strange gray city!

<h2><a name="5">CHAPTER 5</a></h2>
<h3>SIR HOKUS OF POKES</h3>
<p>It was long past sunup before Dorothy awoke. She rubbed her eyes, yawned
once or twice, and then shook the Cowardly Lion. The gates of the city were
open, and although it looked even grayer in the daytime than it looked at
night, the travelers were too hungry to be particular. A large placard was
posted just inside:</p>
<p class="poetry">
    THIS IS POKES!<br>
    DON'T RUN!<br>
    DON'T SING!<br>
    TALK SLOWLY!<br>
    DON'T WHISTLE!<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp <i>Order of the Chief Poker.</i></p>
<p>
read Dorothy. "How cheerful! Hah, hoh, hum-mm!"
</p><p>
"Don't!" begged the Cowardly Lion with tears in his eyes. "If I yawn again,
I'll swallow my tail, and if I don't have something to eat soon, I'll do it
anyway. Let's hurry! There's something queer about this place, Dorothy! Ah,
hah, hoh, hum-mm!"
</p><p>
Stifling their yawns, the two started down the long, narrow street. The
houses were of gray stone, tall and stiff with tiny barred windows. It was
absolutely quiet, and not a person was in sight. But when they turned the
corner, they saw a crowd of queer-looking people creeping toward them.
These singular individuals stopped between each step and stood perfectly
still, and Dorothy was so surprised at their unusual appearance that she
laughed right in the middle of a yawn.
</p><p>
In the first place, they never lifted their feet, but pushed them along like
skates. The women were dressed in gray polka-dot dresses with huge poke
bonnets that almost hid their fat, sleepy, wide-mouthed faces. Most of them
had pet snails on strings, and so slowly did they move that it looked as
though the snails were tugging them along.
</p><p>
The men were dressed like a party of congressmen, but instead of high hats
wore large red nightcaps, and they were all as solemn as owls. It seemed
impossible for them to keep both eyes open at the same time, and at first
Dorothy thought they were winking at her. But as the whole company continued
to stare fixedly with one open eye, she burst out laughing. At the unexpected
sound (for no one had ever laughed in Pokes before), the women picked up their
snails in a great fright, and the men clapped their fingers to their ears or
to the places where their ears were under the red nightcaps.
</p><p>
"These must be the Slow Pokes," giggled Dorothy, nudging the Cowardly Lion.
"Let's go to meet them, for they'll never reach us at the rate they are
coming!"
</p><p>
"There's something wrong with my feet," rumbled the Cowardly Lion without
looking up. "Hah, hoh, hum! What's the use of hurrying?" The fact of the
matter was that they couldn't hurry if they tried. Indeed, they could
hardly lift their feet at all.
</p><p>
"I wish the Scarecrow were with us," sighed the Cowardly Lion, shuffling along
unhappily. "He never grows sleepy, and he always knows what to do."
</p><p>
"No use wishing," yawned Dorothy. "I only hope he's not as lost as we are."
</p><p>
By struggling hard, they just managed to keep moving, and by the time they
came up with the Slow Pokes, they were completely worn out. A cross-looking
Poke held up his arm threateningly, and Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion
stopped.
</p><p>
"You&mdash;" said the Poke; then closed his mouth and stood staring
vacantly for a whole minute.
</p><p>
"Are&mdash;" He brought out the word with a perfectly enormous yawn, and Dorothy
began fanning the Cowardly Lion with her hat, for he showed signs of falling
asleep again.
</p><p>
"What?" she asked crossly.
</p><p>
"Under&mdash;" sighed the Poke after a long pause, and Dorothy, seeing that
there was no hurrying him, began counting to herself. Just as she reached
sixty, the Poke pushed back his red nightcap and shouted:
</p><p>
"Arrest!"
</p><p>
"Arrest!" shouted all the other Pokes so loud that the Cowardly Lion roused
himself with a start, and the pet snails stuck out their heads.
"A rest? A rest is not what we want! We want breakfast!" growled the lion
irritably and started to roar, but a yawn spoiled it. (One simply cannot
look fierce by yawning.)
</p><p>
"You&mdash;" began the Poke. But Dorothy could not stand hearing the same
slow speech again. Putting her fingers in her ears, she shouted back:
</p><p>
"What for?"
</p><p>
The Pokes regarded her sternly. Some even opened both eyes. Then the one who
had first addressed them, covering a terrific gape with one hand, pointed
with the other to a sign on a large post at the corner of the street.
</p><p class="poetry">
    "Speed limit 1/4 mile an hour" said the sign.
</p><p>
"We're arrested for speeding!" shouted Dorothy in the Cowardly Lion's ear.
</p><p>
"Did you say feeding?" asked the poor lion, waking up with a start. "If I go
to sleep again before I'm fed, I'll starve to death!"
</p><p>
"Then keep awake," yawned Dorothy. By this time, the Pokes had surrounded
them and were waving them imperiously ahead. They looked so threatening
that Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion began to creep in the direction of a
gloomy, gray castle. Of the journey neither of them remembered a thing, for
with the gaping and yawning Pokes it was almost impossible to keep awake.
But they must have walked in their sleep, for the next thing Dorothy knew,
a harsh voice called slowly:
</p><p>
"Poke&mdash;him!"
</p><p>
Greatly alarmed, Dorothy opened her eyes. They were in a huge stone hall
hung all over with rusty armor, and seated on a great stone chair, snoring
so loudly that all the steel helmets rattled, was a Knight. The tallest and
crossest of the Pokes rushed at him with a long poker, giving him such a
shove that he sprawled to the floor.
</p><p>
"So&mdash;" yawned the Cowardly Lion, awakened by the clatter, "Knight has
fallen!"
</p><p>
"Prisoners&mdash;Sir Hokus!" shouted the Chief Poker, lifting the Knight's plume
and speaking into the helmet as if he were telephoning.
</p><p>
The Knight arose with great dignity, and after straightening his armor, let
down his visor, and Dorothy saw a kind, timid face with melancholy blue
eyes&mdash;not at all Pokish, as she explained to Ozma later.
</p><p>
"What means this unwonted clamor?" asked Sir Hokus, peering curiously at the
prisoners.
</p><p>
"We're sorry to waken you," said Dorothy politely, "but could you please
give us some breakfast?"
</p><p>
"A lot!" added the Cowardly Lion, licking his chops.
</p><p align="center"><img src="images/77.jpg" alt="Sir Hokus sings">
</p><p>
"It's safer for me to sing," said the Knight mournfully, and throwing back
his head, he roared in a high, hoarse voice:
</p><p class="poetry">
    "Don't yawn! Don't yawn!<br>
    We're out of breath&mdash;<br>
    Begone&mdash;BEGONE<br>
    Or die the death!"</p>
<p>
The Cowardly Lion growled threateningly and began lashing his tail.
</p><p>
"If he weren't in a can, I'd eat him," he rumbled, "but I never could abide
tinned meat."
</p><p>
"He's not in a can, he's in armor," explained Dorothy, too interested to pay
much attention to the Cowardly Lion, for at the first note of the Knight's
song, the Pokes began scowling horribly, and by the time he had finished
they were backing out of the room faster than Dorothy ever imagined they
could go.
</p><p>
"So that's why the sign said don't sing," thought Dorothy to herself. The
air seemed clearer somehow, and she no longer felt sleepy.
</p><p>
When the last Poke had disappeared, the Knight sighed and climbed gravely
back on his stone chair.
</p><p>
"My singing makes them very wroth. In faith, they cannot endure music; it
wakens them," explained Sir Hokus. "But hold, 'twas food you asked of me.
Breakfast, I believe you called it." With an uneasy glance at the Cowardly
Lion, who was sniffing the air hungrily, the Knight banged on his steel armor
with his sword, and a fat, lazy Poke shuffled slowly into the hall.
</p><p>
"Pid, bring the stew," roared Sir Hokus as the Poke stood blinking at them
dully.
</p><p>
"Stew, Pid!" he repeated loudly, and began to hum under his breath,
at which Pid fairly ran out of the room, returning in a few minutes with a
large yellow bowl. This he handed ungraciously to Dorothy. Then he brought
a great copper tub of the stuff for the Cowardly Lion and retired sulkily.
</p><p>
Dorothy thought she had never tasted anything more delicious. The Cowardly
Lion was gulping down his share with closed eyes, and both, I am very sorry
to say, forgot even to thank Sir Hokus.
</p><p>
"Are you perchance a damsel in distress?"
</p><p>
Quite startled, Dorothy looked up from her bowl and saw the Knight regarding
her wistfully.
</p><p>
"She's in Pokes, and that's the same thing," said the Cowardly Lion without
opening his eyes.
</p><p>
"We're lost," began the little girl, "but&mdash;"
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/79.jpg" alt="Pid brings the stew"></p>
<p>
There was something so quaint and gentle about the Knight, that she soon found
herself talking to him like an old friend. She told him all of their
adventures since leaving the Emerald City and even told about the
disappearance of the Scarecrow.
</p><p>
"Passing strange, yet how refreshing," murmured Sir Hokus. "And if I seem a
little behind times, you must not blame me. For centuries, I have dozed in
this gray castle, and it cometh over me that things have greatly changed.
This beast now, he talks quite manfully, and this Kingdom that you mention,
this Oz? Never heard of it!"
</p><p>
"Never heard of Oz?" gasped the little girl. "Why, you're a subject of Oz,
and Pokes is in Oz, though I don't know just where."
</p><p>
Here Dorothy gave him a short history of the Fairy country, and of the many
adventures she had had since she had come there. Sir Hokus listened with
growing melancholy.
</p><p>
"To think," he sighed mournfully, "that I was prisoner here while all that
was happening!"
</p><p>
"Are <i>you</i> a prisoner?" asked Dorothy in surprise. "I thought you were
King of the Pokes!"
</p><p>
"Uds daggers!" thundered Sir Hokus so suddenly that Dorothy jumped. "I am a
<i>knight!"</i>
</p><p>
Seeing her startled expression, he controlled himself. "I was a knight," he
continued brokenly. "Long centuries ago, mounted on my goodly steed, I fared
from my father's castle to offer my sword to a mighty king. His name?" Sir
Hokus tapped his forehead uncertainly. "Go to, I have forgot."
</p><p>
"Could it have been King Arthur?" exclaimed Dorothy, wide-eyed with interest.
"Why, just think of your being still alive!"
</p><p>
"That's just the point," choked the Knight. "I've been alive&mdash;still, so
still that I've forgotten everything. Why, I can't even remember how I used
to talk," he confessed miserably.
</p><p>
"But how did you get here?" rumbled the Cowardly Lion, who did not like being
left out of the conversation.
</p><p>
"I had barely left my father's castle before I met a stranger," said Sir
Hokus, sitting up very straight, "who challenged me to battle. I spurred my
horse forward, our lances met, and the stranger was unseated. But by my faith,
'twas no mortal Knight." Sir Hokus sighed deeply and lapsed into silence.
</p><p>
"What happened?" asked Dorothy curiously, for Sir Hokus seemed to have
forgotten them.
</p><p>
"The Knight," said he with another mighty sigh, "struck the ground with his
lance and cried, 'Live Wretch, for centuries in the stupidest country out
of the world,' and disappeared. And here&mdash;here I am!" With a despairing
gesture, Sir Hokus arose, big tears splashing down his armor.
</p><p>
"I feel that I am brave, very brave, but how am I to know until I have
encountered danger? Ah, friends, behold in me a Knight who has never had a
real adventure, never killed a dragon, nor championed a Lady, nor gone on a
Quest!"
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/83.jpg" alt="Dropping on his knees"></p>
<p>
Dropping on his knees before the little girl, Sir Hokus took her hand. "Let
me go with you on this Quest for the valiant Scarecrow. Let me be your good
Night!" he begged eagerly.
</p><p>
"Good night," coughed the Cowardly Lion, who, to tell the truth, was feeling
a bit jealous. But Dorothy was thrilled, and as Sir Hokus continued to look
at her pleadingly, she took off her hair ribbon and bound it 'round his arm.
</p><p>
"You shall be my own true Knight, and I your Lady Fair!" she announced
solemnly, and exactly as she had read in books.
</p><p>
At this interesting juncture the Cowardly Lion gave a tremendous yawn, and
Sir Hokus with an exclamation of alarm jumped to his feet. The Pokes had
returned to the hall, and Dorothy felt herself falling asleep again.
</p><p class="poetry">
    Up, up, my lieges and away!<br>
    We take the field again&mdash;<br>

    For Ladies fair we fight today<br>
    And KING! Up, up, my merry men!
</p><p>
shrilled the Knight as if he were leading an army to battle. The Pokes
opened both eyes, but did not immediately retire. Sir Hokus bravely
swallowed a yawn and hastily clearing his throat shouted another song,
which he evidently made up on the spur of the moment:
</p><p class="poetry">
    Avaunt! Be off! Be gone&mdash;Methinks<br>
    We'll be asleep in forty winks!
</p><p>
This time the Pokes left sullenly, but the effect of their presence had thrown
Dorothy, the Cowardly Lion, and the Knight into a violent fit of the gapes.
</p><p>
"If I fall asleep, nothing can save you," said Sir Hokus in an agitated
voice. "Hah, hoh, hum! Hah&mdash;!"
</p><p>
The Knight's eyes closed.
</p><p>
"Don't do it, don't do it!" begged Dorothy, shaking him violently. "Can't we
run away?"
</p><p>
"I've been trying for five centuries," wailed the Knight in a discouraged
voice, "but I always fall asleep before I reach the gate, and they bring me
back here. They're rather fond of me in their slow way," he added
apologetically.
</p><p>
"Couldn't you keep singing?" asked the Cowardly Lion anxiously, for the
prospect of a five-century stay in Pokes was more than he could bear.
</p><p>
"Couldn't we <i>all</i> sing?" suggested Dorothy. "Surely all three of us won't
fall asleep at once."
</p><p>
"I'm not much of a singer," groaned the Cowardly Lion, beginning to tremble,
"but I'm willing to do my share!"
</p><p>
"I like you," said Sir Hokus, going over and thumping the Cowardly Lion
approvingly on the back. "You ought to be knighted!"
</p><p>
The lion blinked his eyes, for Sir Hokus' iron fist bruised him severely,
but knowing it was kindly meant, he bore it bravely.
</p><p>
"I am henceforth a beknighted lion," he whispered to Dorothy while Sir Hokus
was straightening his armor. Next the Knight took down an iron poker, which he
handed to Dorothy.
</p><p>
"To wake us up with," he explained. "And now, Lady Dorothy, if you are ready,
we will start on the Quest for the honorable Scarecrow, and remember,
everybody sing&mdash;<i>Sing for your life!"</i>
</p>

<h2><a name="6">CHAPTER 6</a></h2>
<h3>SINGING THEIR WAY OUT OF POKES</h3>

<p>
Taking a deep breath, Sir Hokus, the Cowardly Lion and Dorothy burst out of
the hall singing at the top of their voices.
</p><p>
"Three blind mice&mdash;!" sang Dorothy.
</p><p>
"Across the plain!" shouted Sir Hokus.
</p><p>
"I am the Cowardly Lion of Oz!" roared the lion.
</p><p>
The Pokes were so taken aback at the horrid sounds that they ran scurrying
right and left. In another minute the three were out of the castle and
singing their way through the gloomy garden. Dorothy stuck to the Three
Blind Mice. Sir Hokus sang verse after verse of an old English ballad, and
the Cowardly Lion roared and gurgled a song of his own making, which,
considering it was a first attempt, was not so bad:
</p><p class="poetry">
    I am the Cowardly Lion of Oz!<br>
    Be good! Begone! Beware! Becoz<br>
    When I am scared full fierce I be;<br>
    Br&mdash;rah&mdash;grr&mdash;ruff, look out for me!
</p><p>
The Pokes stumbled this way and that, and all went well until they rushed
into a company of Pokes who were playing croquet. The slowness with which
they raised their mallets fascinated Dorothy, and she stopped to watch them
in spite of herself.
</p><p>
"Don't stop! Sing!" growled the Cowardly Lion in the middle of a line. To
make up for lost time, Dorothy closed her eyes and sang harder than ever,
but alas! next instant she fell over a wicket, which so deprived her of
breath that she could barely scramble up, let alone sing. As soon as she
stopped singing, the Pokes paused in their flight, and as soon as they
paused Dorothy began to gape. Singing for dear life, Sir Hokus jerked
Dorothy by the arm, and the Cowardly Lion roared so loud that the Pokes
covered their ears and began backing away.
</p><p>
"There was a Knight! Come on, come on!" sang Sir Hokus, and Dorothy came,
and in a few minutes was able to take up the "Three Blind Mice" again. But
running and singing at the same time is not an easy task. And running
through Pokes is like trying to run through water. (You know how hard that
is?)
</p><p>
"Three Blind Mice&mdash;uh&mdash;hah&mdash;Three Blind&mdash;Mice&mdash;uh-hah&mdash;I
can't sing another note! Thu&mdash;ree&mdash;!" gasped poor Dorothy, stumbling
along, while the Cowardly Lion was puffing like an engine. The Pokes in the
garden had recovered from their first alarm and were following at a safe
distance. The gates of the city were only a short distance off, but it
seemed to Dorothy that she could not go another step.
</p><p>
A large group of Pokes had gathered at the gates, and unless they could sing
their way through, they would fall asleep and be carried ignominiously back
to the castle.
</p><p>
"Now!" wheezed Sir Hokus, "Remember, it is for the Scarecrow!" All of them
swallowed, took a deep breath, and put their last remaining strength into
their voices. But a wily Poke who had stuffed some cotton in his ears now
approached pushing a little cart.
</p><p>
"Take&mdash;!" he drawled, and before Dorothy realized what she was doing,
she had accepted a cone from the Poke.
</p><p>
"Hah, hoh, hum! Why, it's hokey pokey!" spluttered Dorothy, and with a deep
sigh of delight she took a large bite of the pink ice cream. How cool it
felt on her dry throat! She opened her mouth for a second taste, yawned
terrifically, and fell with a thud to the stone pavement.
</p><p>
"Dorothy!" wailed Sir Hokus, stopping short in his song and bending over the
little girl. The poor Cowardly Lion gave a gulp of despair and began
running around the two, roaring and singing in a choked voice. The Pokes
nodded to each other in a pleased fashion, and the Chief Poker started
cautiously toward them with a long, thick rope. The Cowardly Lion redoubled
his efforts. Then, seeing Sir Hokus about to fall, he jumped on the Knight
with all his strength. Down crashed Sir Hokus, his armor clanging against
the stones that paved the gateway.
</p><p>
"Sing!" roared the Cowardly Lion, glaring at him fiercely. The fall wakened
the poor Knight, but he had not the strength to rise. Sitting on the hard
stones and looking reproachfully at the Cowardly Lion, he began his ballad
in a half-hearted fashion. The Cowardly Lion's heart was like to burst
between lack of breath and fear, but making one last tremendous effort and
still roaring his song, he bounded at the Chief Poker, seized the rope, and
was back before the stupid creature had time to yawn.
</p><p>
"Tie it around your waist; take Dorothy in your arms!" gasped the Cowardly
Lion out of the corner of his mouth. Sir Hokus, though completely dazed,
had just enough presence of mind to obey, and the next minute the Cowardly
Lion, growling between his teeth like a good fellow, was dashing through
the group of Pokes, the other end of the rope in his mouth.
</p><p>
Bumpety bump&mdash;bump&mdash;bump! Bangety-bang-bang! went Sir Hokus over the
cobbles, holding his helmet with one hand and Dorothy fast in the other arm.
The Pokes fell this way and that, and such was the determination of the
Cowardly Lion that he never stopped till he was out of the gate and halfway
up the rough road they had so recently traveled. Then with a mighty sigh,
he dropped the rope, rolled over and over down the hill, and lay panting
with exhaustion at the bottom.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/92.jpg" alt="St. Hokus rolls down the hill"></p>
<p>
The bumping over the cobbles had wakened Sir Hokus thoroughly. Indeed, the
poor Knight was black and blue, and his armor dented and scraped
frightfully in important places.
</p><p>
Dorothy, considerably shaken, opened her eyes and began feebly singing "Three
Blind Mice."
</p><p>
"No need," puffed Sir Hokus, lifting her off his lap and rising stiffly.
</p><p>
"Yon noble beast has rescued us."
</p><p>
"Won't the Pokes come up here?" asked Dorothy, staring around a bit dizzily.
</p><p>
"They cannot live out of the kingdom," said the Knight, and Dorothy drew a
big sigh of relief. Sir Hokus, however, was looking very grave.
</p><p>
"I have failed on my first adventure. Had it not been for the Cowardly Lion,
we would now be prisoners in Pokes," he murmured sadly. Then he unfastened the
plume from his helmet. "It beseemeth me not to wear it," sighed the Knight
mournfully, and though Dorothy tried her best to comfort him, he refused to
put it back. Finally, she fastened the plume to her dress, and they went
down to the Cowardly Lion.
</p><p>
There was a little spring nearby, and after they had poured six helmets of
water over his head, the lion opened his eyes. "Been in a good many
fights," gasped the lion, "but I never fought one like this. Singing, bah!"
</p><p>
"Noble Sir, how can I ever repay you?" faltered the Knight. "Alas, that I
have failed in the hour of trial!"
</p><p>
"Why, it wasn't a question of courage at all," rumbled the Cowardly Lion,
greatly embarrassed. "I had the loudest voice and the most breath, that's
all! You got the rough end of it." Sir Hokus looked ruefully at his armor.
The back was entirely squashed.
</p><p>
"Never mind!" said the Knight bravely. "It is the front one presents to the
foe."
</p><p>
"Now you're talking like a real Knight," said Dorothy. "A while ago you
said, 'Yon' and 'beseemeth,' and first thing you know the talk will all
come back to you." Sir Hokus' honest face shone with pleasure.
</p><p>
"Odds bludgeons and truncheons! The little maid is right!" he exclaimed,
striking an attitude. "And once it does, the rest will be easy."
</p><p>
"Don't say rest to me," begged the Cowardly Lion, getting slowly to his
feet. "Hah, hoh, hum! Just to think of it makes me yawn. Now don't you
think we had better start off?"
</p><p>
"If you're rested," began Dorothy. The Cowardly Lion put his paw over his
ear and looked so comical that both Dorothy and Sir Hokus laughed heartily.
</p><p>
"If you're ready," amended Dorothy, and the three adventurers started up the
steep road. "The first thing to do," said the little girl, "is to get back
to the Emerald City as quickly as we can."
</p><p>
At this very minute Glinda, the Good Sorceress of Oz, in her palace in the
Quadling Country, was puzzling over an entry in the Magic Record Book. This
book tells everything that is happening in the world and out, and while it
does not give details, it is a very useful possession.
</p><p>
"The Emperor of the Silver Islands," read Glinda, "has returned to his
people."
</p><p>
"Now who is the Emperor of the Silver Islands?" she asked herself. She
puzzled about it for a long while, and then, deciding that it had nothing
to do with the Fairy Kingdom of Oz, she closed the book and went for a walk
in the palace garden.
</p><p>
Dorothy and Sir Hokus and the Cowardly Lion had meanwhile reached the first
sign in the dim forest, the sign directing travelers to Pokes. Two roads
branched out through the forest, and after much debating they took the wider.
</p><p>
"Do you 'spose this leads to the Emerald City?" asked Cowardly Lion dubiously.
</p><p>
"Time will tell, time will tell," said Sir Hokus cheerfully.
</p><p>
"Yes," murmured the Cowardly Lion, "time will tell. But what?"

<h2><a name="7">CHAPTER 7</a></h2>
<h3>THE SCARECROW IS HAILED AS EMPEROR!</h3>
<p>
Leaning forward on the great throne, the Scarecrow waited impatiently for
the ancient gentleman to speak. The gray-skinned courtiers were eyeing him
expectantly, and just as the suspense became almost unendurable, the old
man threw up his arms and cried sharply:
</p><p>
"The prophecy of the magic beanstalk has been fulfilled. In this radiant and
sublime Scarecrowcus, the spirit of Chang Wang Woe, the mighty, has returned.
And I, the Grand Chew Chew of the realm, prostrate myself before this
wonderful Scarecrowcus, Emperor of the Silver Islands." So, likewise, did all
the company present, and the Scarecrow, taken unawares, flew up several feet
and landed in a heap on the steps leading to the throne. He climbed back
hurriedly, picking up the fan and parasol that he had plucked from the
beanstalk.
</p><p>
"I wish Professor Wogglebug could hear this," said the Scarecrow, settling
himself complacently. "But I must watch out, and remember to hold on."
</p><p>
The Grand Chew Chew was the first to rise, and folding his arms, he asked
solemnly:
</p><p>
"What are your commands, Ancient and Honorable Scarecrowcus?"
</p><p>
"If you'd just omit the Cus," begged the Scarecrow in an embarrassed voice,
"I believe I could think better. Am I in China, or where? Are you Chinamen,
or what?"
</p><p>
"We are Silvermen," said the Grand Chew Chew impressively, "and a much older
race than our Chinese cousins. They are people of the sun. We are people of
the stars. Has your Highness so soon forgotten?"
</p><p>
"I am afraid," said the Scarecrow, rubbing his chin reflectively, "that I
have." He gazed slowly around the great throne room. Ozma's palace itself
was not more dazzling. The floor of dull silver blocks was covered with
rich blue rugs. Furniture, chairs, screens and everything were made of
silver inlaid with precious stones. Filigreed silver lanterns hung from the
high ceilings, and tall silver vases filled with pink and blue blossoms
filled the rooms with their perfume. Blue flags embroidered with silver
stars fluttered from the walls and the tips of the pikebearers' spears, and
silver seemed to be so plentiful that even shoes were fashioned of it.
Faintly through the windows came the sweet tones of a hundred silver chimes,
and altogether the Scarecrow was quite dazed by his apparent good fortune.
Surely they had called him Emperor, but how could that be? He turned to
address the Grand Chew Chew; then as he saw out of the corner of his eye
that the assemblage were making ready to fall upon their faces, he
exclaimed in a hoarse whisper:
</p><p>
"May I speak to you alone?" The Grand Chew Chew waved his hand imperiously,
and the courtiers with a great crackling of silver brocade backed from the
hall.
</p><p>
"Very kind of them to bow, but I wish they wouldn't," sighed the Scarecrow,
sinking back on the great throne. "It blows one about so. I declare, if
another person falls at my feet, I'll have nervous prostration."
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/100.jpg" alt="The Scarecrow is nervous"></p>
<p>
Again he took a long survey of the hall, then turned to the Grand Chew Chew.
"Would you mind," he asked simply, "telling me again who I am and how?"
</p><p>
"Who and how? Who&mdash;You are, illustrious Sir, the Emperor Chang Wang Woe, or
to be more exact, his spirit!"
</p><p>
"I have always been a spirited person," observed the Scarecrow dubiously,
"but never a spirit without a person. I must insist on being a person."
</p><p>
"How?" the Grand Chew Chew proceeded without noticing the Scarecrow's remarks.
"Fifty years ago&mdash;after your Extreme Highness had defeated in battle the
King of the Golden Islands&mdash;a magician entered the realm. This magician, in
the employ of this wicked king, entered a room in the palace where your
Highness lay sleeping and by an act of necromancy changed you to a crocus!"
</p><p>
"Ouch!" exclaimed the Scarecrow, shuddering involuntarily.
</p><p>
"And had it not been for the Empress, your faithful wife, you would have
been lost forever to the Empire."
</p><p>
"Wife?" gasped the Scarecrow faintly. "Have I a wife?"
</p><p>
"If your Highness will permit me to finish," begged the Grand Chew Chew with
great dignity. The Scarecrow nodded. "Your wife, Tsing Tsing, the
beautiful, took the crocus, which was fading rapidly, and planted it in a
silver bowl in the center of this very hall and for three days kept it
fresh with her tears. Waking on the third morning, the Empress was amazed
to see in place of the crocus a giant bean pole that extended to the roof
of the palace and disappeared among the clouds."
</p><p>
"Ah!" murmured the Scarecrow, looking up, "My family tree!"
</p><p>
"Beside the bean pole lay a crumpled parchment." The Grand Chew Chew felt in
the sleeve of his kimono and brought out a bit of crumpled silver paper,
and adjusting his horn spectacles, read slowly.
</p><p>
"Into the first being who touches this magic pole&mdash;on the other side of the
world&mdash;the spirit of Emperor Chang Wang Woe will enter. And fifty years from
this day, he will return&mdash;to save his people."
</p><p>
The Grand Chew Chew took off his specs and folded up the paper. "The day has
come! You have come down the bean pole, and are undoubtedly that being who has
gone from Emperor to crocus to Scarecrowcus. I have ruled the Islands these
fifty years; have seen to the education of your sons and grandsons. And now,
gracious and exalted Master, as I am an old man I ask you to relieve me from
the cares of state."
</p><p>
"Sons! Grandsons!" choked the Scarecrow, beginning to feel very much alarmed
indeed. "How old am I?"
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/103.jpg" alt="Very much alarmed"></p>
<p>
"Your Highness," said the Grand Chew Chew with a deep salaam, "is as old as
I. In other words, you are in the ripe and glorious eighty-fifth year of
your Majesty's illustrious and useful age."
</p><p>
"Eighty five!" gasped the Scarecrow, staring in dismay at the gray,
wrinkled face of the old Silverman. "Now see here, Chew Chew, are you sure
of that?"
</p><p>
"Quite sure, Immortal and Honored Master!"
</p><p>
The Scarecrow could not help but be convinced of the truth of the Grand Chew
Chew's story. The pole in the Munchkin farmer's cornfield was none other
than the magic beanstalk, and he, thrust on the pole by the farmer to scare
away the crows, had received the spirit of the Emperor Chang Wang Woe.
"Which accounts for my cleverness," he thought gloomily. Now, surely he
should have been pleased, for he had come in search of a family, but the
acquisition of an empire, sons and grandsons, and old age, all in a trice,
fairly took his breath away.
</p><p>
"Does the prophecy say anything about restoring my imperial person?" he asked
anxiously, for the thought of looking like Chew Chew was not a cheerful one.
</p><p>
"Alas, no!" sighed the Grand Chew Chew sorrowfully. "But we have very clever
wizards on the Island, and I shall set them at work on the problem at once."
</p><p>
"Now don't be in such a rush," begged the Scarecrow, secretly determined to
lock up the wizards at the first opportunity. "I'm rather fond of this
shape. You see, it requires no food and never grows tired&mdash;or old!"
</p><p>
"The royal robes will in a measure conceal it," murmured the Grand Chew Chew
politely, and clapped his hands. A little servitor bounced into the hall.
</p><p>
"A royal robe, Quick Silver, for his Radiant Highness," snapped the Grand
Chew Chew. In a moment Quick Silver had returned with a magnificent purple
satin robe embroidered in silver threads and heavy with jewels, and a hat
of silver cloth with upturned brim. The Scarecrow wrapped himself in the
purple robe, took off his old Munchkin hat, and substituted the Imperial
headpiece.
</p><p>
"How do I look, Chew?" he asked anxiously.
</p><p align="center"><img src="images/105.jpg" alt="How do I look?">
</p><p>
"Quite like your old Imperial Self, except&mdash;" The old Prime Minister
ran unsteadily out of the room. There was a muffled scream from the hall,
and the next instant he returned with a long, shiny, silver queue which he
had evidently clipped from the head of one of the servants. Removing the
Scarecrow's hat, he pinned the queue to the back, set it on the Scarecrow's
head, and stood regarding him with great satisfaction. "Ah, if the Empress
could only see you!" he murmured rapturously.
</p><p>
"Where&mdash;where is she?" asked the Scarecrow, looking around nervously. His
long, care-free life in Oz had somewhat unfitted him, he reflected, for
family life.
</p><p>
"Alas!" sighed the Grand Chew Chew, wiping his eyes on the sleeve of his
kimono, "She has returned to her silver ancestors."
</p><p>
"Then show me her picture," commanded the Scarecrow, visibly affected. The
Grand Chew Chew stepped to a side wall, and pulling on a silken cord,
disclosed the picture of a large, gray lady with curiously small eyes and a
curiously large nose.
</p><p>
"Is she not beautiful?" asked the Grand Chew Chew, bowing his head.
</p><p>
"Beautiful&mdash;er&mdash;er, beautiful!" gulped the Scarecrow. He thought of lovely
little Ozma and dear little Dorothy, and all at once felt terribly upset
and homesick. He had no recollection of the Silver Island or his life here
whatever. Who was he, anyway&mdash;the Scarecrow of Oz or Emperor Chang Wang
Woe? He couldn't be both.
</p><p>
"Ah!" whispered the Grand Chew Chew, seeing his agitation. "You remember
her?" The Scarecrow shook his head, with an inward shudder.
</p><p>
"Now show me myself, Chew," he asked curiously. Pulling the cord of a portrait
beside the Empress, Chew Chew revealed the picture of Chang Wang Woe as he had
been fifty years ago. His face was bland and jolly, and to be perfectly
truthful, quite like the Scarecrow's in shape and expression. "I am beside
myself," murmured the Scarecrow dazedly&mdash;which in truth he was.
</p><p>
"You were&mdash;er&mdash;are a very royal and handsome person," stammered the Grand
Chew Chew.
</p><p>
The Scarecrow, stepping off the throne to examine himself more closely,
dropped the little fan and parasol. He had really not had time to examine
them since they snapped off the beanstalk, and now, looking at them
carefully, he found them extremely pretty.
</p><p>
"Dorothy will like these," thought the Scarecrow, slipping them into a large
inside pocket of his robe. Already, in the back of his head, was a queer
notion that he would at some time or other return to Oz. He started to give
the Grand Chew Chew a spirited description of that wonderful country, but the
ancient gentleman yawned and, waving his hands toward the door, interrupted
him with:
</p><p>
"Would not your Supreme Highness care to inspect your present dominions?"
</p><p>
"I suppose I may as well!" With a deep sigh, the Scarecrow took the Grand
Chew Chew's arm and, holding up his royal kimono (which was rather long)
with the other hand, walked unsteadily down the great salon. They were
about to pass into the garden when a little fat Silverman slid around the
door, a huge silver drumstick upraised in his right hand and a great drum
hung about his neck.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/108.jpg" alt="A great drum hung around his neck"></p>
<p>
The drummer beamed on the Scarecrow.
</p>
<p class="poetry">
    Chang Wang Woe, the Beautiful,<br>
    The Beautiful has come!<br>
    Sublime and silver Scarecrow,<br>
    Let sound the royal drum!</p>
<p>
chanted the little man in a high, thin voice, and started to bring the
drumstick down upon the huge head of his noisy instrument.
</p><p>
"No you don't!" cried the Scarecrow, leaping forward and catching his arm.
</p><p>
"I positively forbid it!"
</p><p>
"Then I shall have no work!" screamed the drummer, falling on his face. "Ah,
Gracious Master, don't you remember me?"
</p><p>
"Yes," said the Scarecrow kindly, "who are you?"
</p><p>
"Oh, don't you remember little Happy Toko?" wheezed the little man, the tears
rolling down his cheeks. "I was only a boy, but you used to be fond of me."
</p><p>
"Why, of course, my dear Tappy," said the Scarecrow, not liking to hurt the
little fellow's feelings. "But why do you beat the drum?"
</p><p>
"It is customary to sound the drum at the approach of your Royal Highness,"
put in the Grand Chew Chew importantly.
</p><p>
"Was customary," said the Scarecrow firmly. "My dear Tappy Oko, never sound
it in my presence again; it is too upsetting." Which was true enough, for
one blow of the drum sent the flimsy Scarecrow flying into the air.
</p><p>
"You're dismissed, Happy," snapped the Grand Chew Chew. At this, the little
Silver Islander began weeping and roaring with distress.
</p><p>
"Stop! What else can you do besides beat a drum?" asked the Scarecrow kindly.
</p><p>
"I can sing, stand on my head, and tell jokes," sniffed Happy Toko,
shuffling from one foot to the other.
</p><p>
"Very good," said the Scarecrow. "You are henceforth Imperial Punster to my
Person. Come along, we're going to look over the Island."
</p><p>
The Grand Chew Chew frowned so terribly that Happy Toko's knees shook with
terror.
</p><p>
"It is not fitting for a slave to accompany the Grand Chew Chew and
the Emperor," he hissed angrily.
</p><p>
The Scarecrow looked surprised, for the Kingdom of Oz is quite democratic,
and no one is considered better than another. But seeing this was not the
time to argue, he winked broadly behind the Grand Chew Chew's back.
</p><p>
"I'll see you again, Tappy my boy," he called genially, and passed out into
the garden, where a magnificent silver palanquin, surrounded by pikemen and
shieldbearers, awaited him.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/111.jpg" alt="&quot;I'll see you again, Tappy my boy&quot;"></p>

<h2><a name="8">CHAPTER 8</a></h2>
<h3>THE SCARECROW STUDIES THE SILVER ISLAND</h3>

<p>
Two days had passed since the Scarecrow had fallen into his Kingdom. He was
not finding his royal duties as pleasant as he had anticipated. The country
was beautiful enough, but being Emperor of the Silver Islands was not the
simple affair that ruling Oz had been. The pigtail on the back of his hat
was terribly distracting, and he was always tripping over his kimono, to
which he could not seem to accustom himself. His subjects were extremely
quarrelsome, always pulling one another's queues or stealing fruit,
umbrellas, and silver polish. His ministers, the Grand Chew Chew, the Chief
Chow Chow, and General Mugwump, were no better, and keeping peace in the
palace took all the Scarecrow's cleverness.
</p><p>
In the daytime he tried culprits in the royal court, interviewed his seventeen
secretaries, rode out in the royal palanquin, and made speeches to visiting
princes. At night he sat in the great silver salon and by the light of the
lanterns studied the Book of Ceremonies. His etiquette, the Grand Chew Chew
informed him, was shocking. He was always doing something wrong, dodging the
Imperial Umbrella, speaking kindly to a palace servant, or walking unattended
in the gardens.
</p><p>
The royal palace itself was richly furnished, and the Scarecrow had more than
five hundred robes of state. The gardens, with their sparkling waterfalls,
glowing orange trees, silver temples, towers and bridges, were too lovely for
words. Poppies, roses, lotus and other lilies perfumed the air, and at night a
thousand silver lanterns turned them to a veritable fairyland.
</p><p>
The grass and trees were green as in other lands, but the sky as always full
of tiny silver clouds, the waters surrounding the island were of a lovely
liquid silver, and as all the houses and towers were of this gleaming metal,
the effect was bewildering and beautiful.
</p><p>
But the Silver Islanders themselves were too stupid to appreciate this
beauty. "And what use is it all when I have no one to enjoy it with me,"
sighed the Scarecrow. "And no time to <i>play!"</i>
</p><p>
In Oz no one thought it queer if Ozma, the little Queen, jumped rope with
Dorothy or Betsy Bobbin, or had a quiet game of croquet with the palace cook.
But here, alas, everything was different. If the Scarecrow so much as ventured
a game of ball with the gardener's boy, the whole court was thrown into an
uproar. At first, the Scarecrow tried to please everybody, but finding that
nothing pleased the people in the palace, he decided to please himself.
</p><p>
"I don't care a kinkajou if I am the Emperor, I'm going to talk to
whom I please!" he exclaimed on the second night, and shaking his glove at
a bronze statue, he threw the Book of Ceremonies into the fountain. The
next morning, therefore, he ascended the throne with great firmness.
Immediately, the courtiers prostrated themselves, and the Scarecrow's arms
and legs blew about wildly.
</p><p>
"Stand up at once," puffed the Scarecrow when he had regained his balance.
</p><p>
"You are giving me nervous prostration. Chew, kindly issue an edict forbidding
prostrations. Anyone caught bowing in my presence again shall lose&mdash;" the
courtiers looked alarmed "&mdash;his pigtail!" finished the Scarecrow.
</p><p>
"And now, Chew, you will take my place, please. I am going for a walk with
Tappy Oko."
</p><p>
The Grand Chew Chew's mouth fell open with surprise, but seeing the
Scarecrow's determined expression, he dared not disobey, and he immediately
began making strange marks on a long, red parchment. Happy Toko trembled as
the Scarecrow Emperor took his arm, and the courtiers stared at one another
in dismay as the two walked quietly out into the garden.
</p><p>
Nothing happened, however, and Tappy, regaining his composure, took out a
little silver flute and started a lively tune.
</p><p>
"I had to take matters into my own hands, Tappy," said the Scarecrow,
listening to the music with a pleased expression. "Are there any words to
that song?"
</p><p>
"Yes, illustrious and Supreme Sir!"
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/117.jpg" alt="Tappy played a lively tune"></p>
<p class="poetry">

    Two spoons went down a Por-ce-Lane,<br>
    To meet a China saucer,<br>
    A 'talking China in a way<br>
    To break a white man's jaw, Sir!</p>
<p>
sang Happy, and finished by standing gravely on his head.
</p><p>
"Your Majesty used to be very fond of this song," spluttered Happy. (It is
difficult to speak while upside down, and if you don't think so, try it!)
</p><p>
"Ah!" said the Scarecrow, beginning to feel more cheerful, "Tell me
something about myself and my family, Tappy Oko."
</p><p>
"Happy Toko, if it pleases your Supreme Amiability," corrected the little
silver man, somersaulting to a standstill beside the Scarecrow.
</p><p>
"It does and it doesn't," murmured the Scarecrow. "There is something about
you that reminds me of a pudding, and you tapped the drum, didn't you? I
believe I shall call you Tappy Oko, if you don't mind!"
</p><p>
The Scarecrow seated himself on a silver bench and motioned for the Imperial
Punster to sit down beside him. Tappy Oko sat down fearfully, first making
sure that he was not observed.
</p><p>
"Saving your Imperial Presence, this is not permitted," said Tappy uneasily.
</p><p>
"Never mind about my Imperial Presence," chuckled the Scarecrow. "Tell me
about my Imperial Past."
</p><p>
"Ah!" said Tappy Oko, rolling up his eyes, "You were one of the most
magnificent and magnanimous of monarchs."
</p><p>
"Was I?" asked the Scarecrow in a pleased voice.
</p><p>
"You distributed rice among the poor, and advice among the rich, and fought
many glorious battles," continued the little man. "I composed a little song
about you. Perhaps you would like to hear it?"
</p><p>
The Scarecrow nodded, and Tappy, throwing back his head, chanted with a will:
</p><p class="poetry">
    Chang Wang Woe did draw the bow&mdash;<br>

    And twist the queues of a thousand foe!
</p><p>
"In Oz," murmured the Scarecrow reflectively as Tappy finished, "I twisted
the necks of a flock of wild crows&mdash;that was before I had my excellent
brains, too. Oh, I'm a fighting man, there's no doubt about it. But tell
me, Tappy, where did I meet my wife?"
</p><p>
"In the water!" chuckled Tappy Oko, screwing up his eyes.
</p><p>
"Never!" The Scarecrow looked out over the harbor and then down at his lumpy
figure.
</p><p>
"Your Majesty forgets you were then a man like me&mdash;er&mdash;not stuffed with
straw, I mean," exclaimed Happy, looking embarrassed. "She was fishing,"
continued the little Punster, "when a huge silver fish became entangled in
her line. She stood up, the fish gave a mighty leap and pulled her out of
the boat. Your Majesty, having seen the whole affair from the bank, plunged
bravely into the water and, swimming out, rescued her, freed the fish, and
in due time made her your bride. I've made a song about that, also."
</p><p>
"Let's hear it," said the Scarecrow. And this is what Happy sung:
</p><p class="poetry">
    Tsing Tsing, a Silver Fisher's daughter,<br>
    Was fishing in the silver water.<br>
    The moon shone on her silver hair<br>
    And there were fishes everywhere!
</p><p class="poetry">
    Then came a mighty silver fish,<br>
    It seized her line and with a swish<br>
    Of silver fins upset her boat.<br>
    Tsing Tsing could neither swim nor float.
</p><p class="poetry">
    She raised her silver voice in fear<br>
    And who her call of help should hear<br>
    But Chang Wang Woe, the Emperor,<br>
    Who saved and married her, what's more!
</p><p>
"Did I really?" asked the Scarecrow, feeling quite flattered by Happy's song.
</p><p>
"Yes," said Happy positively, "and invited me to the wedding, though I was
only a small boy."
</p><p>
"Was Chew Chew there?" The Scarecrow couldn't help wondering how the old
Nobleman had taken his marriage with a poor fisherman's daughter.
</p><p>
Happy chuckled at the memory. "He had a Princess all picked out for you," he
confided merrily:
</p><p class="poetry">
    And there he stood in awful pride<br>
    And scorned the father of the bride!
</p><p>
"Hoh!" roared the Scarecrow, falling off the bench. "That's the Ozziest
thing I've heard since I landed in the Silver Islands. Tappy, my boy, I
believe we are going to be friends! But let's forget the past and think of
the present!"
</p><p>
The Scarecrow embraced his Imperial Punster on the spot. "Let's find something
jolly to do," he suggested.
</p><p>
"Would your Extreme Highness care for kites?" asked Happy. "'Tis a favorite
sport here!"
</p><p>
"Would I! But wait, I will disguise myself." Hiding his royal hat under the
bench, he put on Happy Toko's broad-rimmed  peasant hat. It turned
down all 'round and almost hid his face. Then he turned his robe inside out
and declared himself ready.
</p><p>
They passed through a small silver town before they reached the field where
the kites were to be flown, and the Scarecrow was delighted with its
picturesque and quaint appearance. The streets were narrow and full of
queer shops. Silver lanterns and little pennants hung from each door, the
merchants and maidens in their gay sedans and the people afoot made a
bright and lively picture.
</p><p>
"If I could just live here instead of in the palace," mused the Scarecrow,
pausing before a modest rice shop. It is dangerous to stop in the narrow
streets, and Happy jerked his master aside just in time to prevent his being
trodden on by a huge camel. It sniffed at the Scarecrow suspiciously, and they
were forced to flatten themselves against a wall to let it pass. Happy
anxiously hurried the Emperor through the town, and they soon arrived at the
kite flying field. A great throng had gathered to watch the exhibition, and
there were more kites than one would see in a lifetime here. Huge fish, silver
paper dragons, birds&mdash;every sort and shape of kite was tugging at its
string, and hundreds of Silver Islanders&mdash;boys, girls and grown-ups&mdash;were
looking on.
</p><p>
"How interesting," said the Scarecrow, fascinated by a huge dragon that
floated just over his head. "I wish Dorothy could see this, I do indeed!"
</p><p>
But the dragon kite seemed almost alive, and horrors! Just as it swooped
down, a hook in the tail caught in the Scarecrow's collar, and before Happy
Toko could even wink, the Emperor of the Silver Islands was sailing towards
the clouds. The Scarecrow, as you must know, weighs almost nothing, and the
people shouted with glee, for they thought him a dummy man and part of the
performance. But Happy Toko ran after the kite as fast as his fat little
legs would carry him.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/123.jpg" alt="The dragon kite"></p>
<p>
"Alas, alas, I shall lose my position!" wailed Happy Toko, quite convinced
that the Scarecrow would be dashed to pieces on the rocks. "Oh, putty head
that I am to set myself against the Grand Chew Chew!"
</p><p>
The Scarecrow, however, after recovering from the first shock, began to
enjoy himself. Holding fast to the dragon's tail, he looked down with great
interest upon his dominions. Rocks, mountains, tall silver pagodas,
drooping willow trees, flashed beneath him. Truly a beautiful island! His
gaze strayed over the silver waters surrounding the island, and he was
astonished to see a great fleet sailing into the harbor&mdash;a great fleet
of singular vessels with silken sails.
</p><p>
"What's this?" thought the Scarecrow. But just then the dragon kite became
suddenly possessed. It jerked him up, it jerked him down, and shook him
this way and that. His hat flew off, his arms and legs whirled wildly, and
pieces of straw began to float downward. Then the hook ripped and tore
through his coat and, making a terrible slit in his back, came out. Down,
down, down flashed the Scarecrow and landed in a heap on the rocks. Poor
Happy Toko rushed toward him with streaming eyes.
</p><p>
"Oh radiant and immortal Scarecrowcus, what have they done to you?" he
moaned, dropping on his knees beside the flimsy shape of the Emperor.
</p><p>
"Merely knocked out my honorable stuffing," mumbled the Scarecrow. "Now
Tappy, my dear fellow, will you just turn me over? There's a rock in my eye
that keeps me from thinking."
</p><p>
Happy Toko, at the sound of a voice from the rumpled heap of clothing, gave
a great leap.
</p><p>
"Is there any straw about?" asked the Scarecrow anxiously. "Why don't you
turn me over?"
</p><p>
"It's his ghost," moaned Happy Toko, and because he dared not disobey a
royal ghost, he turned the Scarecrow over with trembling hands.
</p><p>
"Don't be alarmed," said the Scarecrow, smiling reassuringly. "I'm not
breakable like you meat people. A little straw will make me good as new. A
little straw&mdash;straw, do you hear?" For Happy's pigtail was still on end,
and he was shaking so that his silver shoes clattered on the rocks.
</p><p>
"I command you to fetch straw!" cried the Scarecrow at last, in an angry
voice. Happy dashed away.
</p><p>
When he returned with an arm full of straw, the Scarecrow managed to convince
him that he was quite alive. "It is impossible to kill a person from Oz," he
explained proudly, "and that is why my present figure is so much more
satisfactory than yours. I do not have to eat or sleep and can always be
repaired. Have you some safety pins?" Happy produced several and under the
Scarecrow's direction stuffed out his chest and pinned up his rents.
</p><p>
"Let us return," said the Scarecrow. "I've had enough pleasure for one day,
and can't you sing something, Tappy?" Running and fright had somewhat
affected Happy's voice, but he squeaked out a funny little song, and the
two, keeping time to the tune, came without further mishap to the Imperial
gardens. Happy had just set the royal hat upon the Scarecrow's head and
brushed off his robes when a company of courtiers dashed out of the palace
door and came running toward them.
</p><p>
"Great Cornstarch!" exclaimed the Scarecrow, sitting heavily down on the
silver bench. "What's the matter now? Here are all the Pig-heads on the
Island, and look how old Chew Chew is puffing!"
</p><p>
"One would expect a Chew Chew to puff," observed Happy slyly. "One
would&mdash;" But he got no further, for the whole company was upon them.
</p><p>
"Save us! Save us!" wailed the courtiers, forgetting the royal edict and
falling on their faces.
</p><p>
"What from?" asked the Scarecrow, holding fast to the silver bench.
</p><p>
"The King&mdash;the King of the Golden Islands!" shrieked the Grand Chew Chew.
</p><p>
"Ah yes!" murmured the Scarecrow, frowning thoughtfully. "Was that his fleet
coming into the harbor?"
</p><p>
The Grand Chew Chew jumped up in astonishment. "How could your Highness see
the fleet from here?" he stuttered.
</p><p>
"Not from here&mdash;there," said the Scarecrow, pointing upward and winking
at Happy Toko. "My Highness goes very high, you see!"
</p><p>
"Your Majesty does not seem to realize the seriousness of the matter,"
choked the Grand Chew Chew. "He will set fire to the island and make us all
slaves." At this, the courtiers began banging their heads distractedly on
the grass.
</p><p>
"Set fire to the island!" exclaimed the Scarecrow, jumping to his feet. "Then
peace to <i>my</i> ashes! Tappy, will you see that they are sent back to Oz?"
</p><p>
"Save us! Save us!" screamed the frightened Silvermen.
</p><p>
"The prophecy of the beanstalk has promised that you would save us. You are
the Emperor Chang Wang Woe," persisted the Grand Chew Chew, waving his long
arms.
</p><p>
"Woe is me," murmured the Scarecrow, clasping his yellow gloves. "But let me
think."
</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><img src="images/129.jpg" alt="Save us!"></p>
<h2><a name="9">CHAPTER 9</a></h2>
<h3>"SAVE US WITH YOUR MAGIC, EXALTED ONE!"</h3>

<p>
For several minutes, the Scarecrow sat perfectly still while the company
stood shaking in their shoes. Then he asked loudly, "Where is the Imperial
Army?"
</p><p>
"It has retired to the caves at the end of the Island," quavered the Grand
Chew Chew.
</p><p>
"I thought as much," said the Scarecrow. "But never mind, there are quite a
lot of us."
</p><p>
"Us!" spluttered a tall Silverman indignantly. "We are not common soldiers."
</p><p>
"No, very uncommon ones, but you have hard heads and long nails, and I dare
say will manage somehow. Come on, let's go. Chew, you may take the lead."
</p><p>
"Go!" shrieked the Grand Chew Chew. "Us?" The Courtiers began backing away
in alarm. "Where&mdash;er&mdash;what&mdash;are your Highness' plans?"
</p><p>
"Why, just to conquer the King of the Golden Islands and send him back home,"
said the Scarecrow, smiling engagingly. "That's what you wanted, isn't it?"
</p><p>
"But it is not honorable for noblemen to fight. It&mdash;"
</p><p>
"Oh, of course, if you prefer burning&mdash;" The Scarecrow rose unsteadily
and started for the garden gates. Not a person stirred. The Scarecrow
looked back, and his reproachful face was too much for Happy Toko.
</p><p>
"I'll come, exalted and radiant Scarecrowcus! Wait, honorable and valiant
Sir!"
</p><p>
"Bring a watering can, if you love me," called the Scarecrow over his
shoulder, and Happy, snatching one from a frightened gardener, dashed after
his Master.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/131.jpg" alt="The Scarecrow"></p>
<p>
"If things get too hot, I'd like to know that you can put me out," said the
Scarecrow, his voice quivering with emotion. "You shall be rewarded for
this, my brave Tappy."
</p><p>
Happy did not answer, for his teeth were chattering so he could not speak.
</p><p>
The harbor lay just below the Imperial Palace, and the Scarecrow and Happy
hurried on through the crowds of fleeing Silvermen, their household goods
packed upon their heads. Some cheered faintly for Chang Wang Woe, but none
offered to follow, save the faithful Happy.
</p><p>
"Is this king old?" asked the Scarecrow, looking anxiously at the small boats
full of warriors that were putting out from the fleet.
</p><p>
"He is the son of the King whom your Majesty conquered fifty years ago,"
gulped Happy. "Ha&mdash;has your Imperial Highness any&mdash;plan?"
</p><p>
"Not yet," said the Scarecrow cheerfully, "but I'm thinking very hard."
</p><p>
"Then, goodbye to Silver Island!" choked Happy Toko, dropping the watering
can with a crash.
</p><p>
"Never mind," said the Scarecrow kindly. "If they shoot me and I catch fire,
I'll jump in the water and you must fish me out, Tappy. Now please don't
talk any more. I must think!"
</p><p>
Poor Happy Toko had nothing else to say, for he considered his day finished.
The first of the invaders were already landing on the beach, and standing
up in a small boat, encased in glittering gold armor, was the King of the
Golden Islands, himself. The sun was quite hot, and there was a smell of
gunpowder in the air.
</p><p>
Now the Scarecrow had encountered many dangers in Oz and had usually thought
his way out of them, but as they came nearer and nearer to the shore and no
idea presented itself, he began to feel extremely nervous. A bullet fired
from the king's boat tore through his hat, and the smoke made him more
anxious than ever about his straw stuffing. He felt hurriedly in his
pocket, and his clumsy fingers closed over the little fan he had plucked
from the bean pole.
</p><p>
Partly from agitation and partly because he did not know what else to do, the
Scarecrow flipped the fan open. At that minute, a mighty roar went up from the
enemy, for at the first motion of the fan they had been jerked fifty feet into
the air, and there they hung suspended over their ships, kicking and squealing
for dear life. The Scarecrow was as surprised as they, and as for Happy Toko,
he fell straightway on his nose!
</p><p>
"Magic!" exclaimed the Scarecrow. "Someone is helping us," and he began
fanning himself gently with the little fan, waiting to see what would happen
next. At each wave of the fan, the King of the Golden Islands and his men flew
higher until at last not one of them could be seen from the shore.
</p><p>
"The fan. The magic is in the fan!" gasped Happy Toko, jumping up and
embracing the Scarecrow.
</p><p>
"Why, what do you mean?" asked the Scarecrow, closing the fan with a snap.
Happy's answer was drowned in a huge splash. As soon as the fan was closed,
down whirled the king's army into the sea, and each man struck the water with
such force that the spray rose high as a skyscraper. And not till then did the
Scarecrow realize the power of the little fan he had been saving for Dorothy.
</p><p>
"Saved!" screamed Happy Toko, dancing up and down. "Hurrah for the Emperor!"
</p><p class="poetry">
    The Emperor, without a plan,<br>

    Has won the victory with a fan.
</p><p>
The Silver Islanders had paused in their flight at the queer noises coming
from the harbor, and now all of them, hearing Tappy Oko's cries, came
crowding down to the shore and were soon cheering themselves hoarse. No
wonder! The drenched soldiers of the king were climbing swiftly back into
their boats, and when they were all aboard, the Scarecrow waved his fan
sidewise (he did not want to blow them up again), and the ships swept
out of the harbor so fast that the water churned to silver suds behind
them, and they soon were out of sight.
</p><p>
"Ah!" cried the Grand Chew Chew, arriving breathlessly at this point, "We
have won the day!"
</p><p>
"So we have!" chuckled the Scarecrow, putting his arm around Happy Toko. "Call
the brave army and decorate the generals!"
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/135.jpg" alt="Putting his arm around Happy Toko"></p>
<p>
"It shall be done," said the Grand Chew Chew, frowning at Happy. "There
shall be a great celebration, a feast, and fireworks."
</p><p>
"Fireworks," quavered the Scarecrow, clutching his Imperial Punster. By this
time, the Silver Islanders were crowding around the Emperor, shouting and
squealing for joy, and before he could prevent it, they had placed him on
their shoulders and carried him in triumph to the palace. He managed to signal
Happy, and Happy nodded reassuringly and ran off as fast as his fat little
legs could patter. He arrived at the palace almost as soon as the Scarecrow,
lugging a giant silver watering can, and, sitting calmly on the steps of the
throne, fanned himself with his hat. The Scarecrow eyed the watering can with
satisfaction.
</p><p>
"Now let them have their old fireworks," he muttered under his breath, and
settled himself comfortably. The Grand Chew Chew was hopping about like a
ditched kite, arranging for the celebration. The courtiers were shaking hands
with themselves and forming in a long line. A great table was being set in the
hall.
</p><p>
"What a fuss they are making over nothing," said the Scarecrow to Happy Toko.
"Now in Oz when we win a victory, we all play some jolly game and sit down to
dinner with Ozma. Why, they haven't even set a place for you, Happy!"
</p><p>
"I'd rather sit here, amiable Master," sighed Happy Toko happily. "Is the
little fan safely closed?"
</p><p>
The Scarecrow felt in his pocket to make sure, then leaned forward in
surprise. The Royal Silver Army were marching stiffly into the hall, and
the courtiers were bobbing and bowing and cheering like mad.
</p><p>
The General came straight to the great silver throne, clicked his silver
heels, bowed, and stood at attention.
</p><p>
"Well," said the Scarecrow, surveying this splendid person curiously, "what is
it?"
</p><p>
"They have come for their decorations," announced the Grand Chew Chew,
stepping up with a large silver platter full of medals.
</p><p>
"But I thought Tappy Oko and I saved the Island," chuckled the Scarecrow,
nudging the Imperial Punster.
</p><p>
"Had the Imperial Army not retired and left the field to you, there would
have been no victory," faltered the General in a timid voice. "Therefore,
in a way we are responsible for the victory. A great general always knows
when to retire."
</p><p>
"There's something in that," admitted the Scarecrow, scratching his head
thoughtfully. "Go ahead and decorate 'em, Chew Chew!"
</p><p>
This the Grand Chew Chew proceeded to do, making such a long speech to each
soldier that half of the Court fell asleep and the Scarecrow fidgeted
uncomfortably.
</p><p>
"They remind me of the Army of Oz," he confided to Happy Toko, "but we never
have long speeches in Oz. I declare, I wish I could go to sleep, too, and
that's something I have never seen any use in before."
</p><p>
"They've just begun," yawned Happy Toko, nearly rolling down the steps of
the throne, and Happy was not far wrong, for all afternoon one after the
other of the courtiers arose and droned about the great victory, and as
they all addressed themselves to the Scarecrow, he was forced to listen
politely. When the speeches were over, there was still the grand banquet to
be got through, and as the Silver Islanders ate much the same fare as their
Chinese cousins, you can imagine the poor Scarecrow's feelings.
</p><p>
"Ugh!" shivered the Scarecrow as the strange dishes appeared, "I'm glad none
of my friends are here. How fortunate that I'm stuffed with straw!" The
broiled mice, the stewed shark fins and the bird nest soup made him stare.
He had ordered Happy Toko to be placed at his side, and to watch him
happily at work with his silver chopsticks and porcelain spoon was the only
satisfaction he got out of the feast.
</p><p>
"And what is that?" he asked, pointing to a steaming bowl that had just been
placed before Happy.
</p><p>
"Minced cat, your Highness," replied Happy, sprinkling it generously with
silver polish.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/139.jpg" alt="&quot;Cat?&quot; shrieked the Scarecrow"></p>
<p>
"Cat?" shrieked the Scarecrow, pouncing to his feet in horror. "Do you mean
to tell me you are eating a poor, innocent, little cat?"
</p><p>
"Not a poor one at all. A very rich one, I should say," replied Happy Toko
with his mouth full. "Ah, had your Highness only your old body, how you
would enjoy this!"
</p><p>
"Never!" shouted the Scarecrow so loudly that all of the Courtiers looked up
in surprise. "How dare you eat innocent cats?" Indignantly he thought of
Dorothy's pet kitten back in Oz. Oz&mdash;why had he ever left that wonderful
country?
</p><p>
"Your Highness has eaten hundreds," announced the Grand Chew Chew calmly.
"Hundreds!"
</p><p>
The Scarecrow dropped back into his chair, too shocked for speech. He, the
Scarecrow of Oz, had eaten hundreds of cats! What would Dorothy say to
that? Ugh! This was his first experience with Silver Island fare. He had
always spent the dinner hours in the garden. He sighed, and looked
wistfully at the bean pole in the center of the hall. Every minute he was
feeling less and less like the Emperor of the Silver Island and more and
more like the plain Scarecrow of Oz.
</p><p>
"Your Majesty seems out of spirits," said Happy Toko as he placed himself and
the huge watering can beside the Emperor's bench in the garden later in the
evening.
</p><p>
"I wish I were," said the Scarecrow. "To have an Emperor's spirit wished on
you is no joke, my dear Tappy. It's a blinking bore!" At that moment, the
fireworks commenced. The garden, ablaze with many shaped silver lanterns,
looked more like Fairyland than ever. But each rocket made the Scarecrow
wince. Showers of stars and butterflies fell 'round his head, fiery dragons
leaped over the trees, and in all the Fourth of July celebrations you could
imagine there were never such marvelous fireworks as these. No wonder Happy
Toko, gazing in delight, forgot his promises to his Royal Master.
</p><p>
Soon the Scarecrow's fears were realized, and his straw stuffing began to
smoke.
</p><p>
"Put me out! Put me out!" cried the Scarecrow, as a shower of sparks settled
in his lap. The royal band made such a din and the courtiers such a clatter
that Happy did not hear.
</p><p>
All of the Silver Islanders were intent on the display, and they forgot all
about their unhappy and smoking Emperor.
</p><p>
"Help! Water! Water! Fire!" screamed the Scarecrow, jumping off his throne and
knocking Happy head over heels. Thus brought to his senses, Happy hurriedly
seized the watering can and sprinkled its contents on the smoking Emperor.
</p><p align="center"><img src="images/105.jpg" alt="Happy sprinkls the Scarecrow with water">
</p><p>
"Am I out?" gasped the Emperor anxiously. "A fine way to celebrate a victory,
lighting me up like a Roman candle!"
</p><p>
"Yes, dear Master," said the repentant Happy, helping the dripping Scarecrow
to his feet, "it only scorched your royal robe. And it's all over, anyway.
Let us go in."
</p><p>
The dripping Emperor was quite ready to follow his Imperial Punster's advice.
</p><p>
"Now that I am put out, let us by all means go in," said the Scarecrow
gloomily, and the two slipped off without anyone noticing their departure.
</p><p>
"I'm afraid I'll have to have some new stuffing tomorrow," observed the
Scarecrow, sinking dejectedly on his throne. "Tappy, my dear boy, after this
never leave me alone, do you hear?" Happy Toko made no reply. He had fallen
asleep beside the Imperial Throne.
</p><p>
The Scarecrow might have called his court, but he was in no mood for more of
the Silver Islanders' idea of a good time. He longed for the dear friends
of his loved Land of Oz.
</p><p>
One by one the lights winked out in the gardens, and the noisy company
dispersed, and soon no one in the palace was awake but the Scarecrow. His
straw was wet and soggy, and even his excellent brains felt damp and dull.
</p><p>
"If it weren't for Tappy Oko, how lonely I should be." He stared through the
long, dim, empty hall with its shimmering silver screens and vases. "I wonder
what little Dorothy is doing," sighed the Scarecrow wistfully.
</p>

<h2><a name="10">CHAPTER 10</a></h2>
<h3>PRINCESS OZMA AND BETSY BOBBIN TALK IT OVER</h3>

<p>
"Dorothy must be having a lovely time at the Scarecrow's," remarked Betsy
Bobbin to Ozma one afternoon as they sat reading in the Royal Gardens
several days after Dorothy's departure from the Emerald City of Oz.
</p><p>
"One always has a jolly time at the Scarecrow's," laughed the little Queen
of Oz. "I must look in my Magic Picture and see what they are doing. Too
bad she missed the A-B-Sea Serpent and Rattlesnakes. Weren't they the
funniest creatures?"
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/146.jpg" alt="Ozma"></p>
<p>
Both the little girls (for Ozma is really just a little girl) went off into
a gale of laughter. The two queer creatures had followed the Scarecrow's
advice and had spent their vacation in the Emerald City, and partly because
they were so dazzled by their surroundings and partly because they have no
sort of memories whatever, they never mentioned the Scarecrow himself or
said anything about his plan to hunt his family tree. They talked incessantly
of the Mer City and told innumerable A-B-Sea stories to Scraps and the Tin
Woodman and the children of the Emerald City. When they were ready to go, the
A-B-Sea Serpent snapped off its X block for Ozma. X, he said, meant almost
everything, and pretty well expressed his gratitude to the lovely little ruler
of Oz. Ozma in turn gave each of the visitors an emerald collar, and that very
morning they had started back to the Munchkin River, and all the celebrities
of Oz had gotten up to see them off.
</p><p>
"Maybe they'll come again some time," said Betsy Bobbin, swinging her feet.
"But look, Ozma, here comes a messenger." A messenger it surely was, dressed
in the quaint red costume of the Quadlings. It was from Glinda, the Good
Sorceress, and caused the Princess to sigh with vexation.
</p><p>
"Tell Jack Pumpkinhead to harness the Sawhorse to the red wagon," said Ozma
after glancing hastily at the little note. "The Horners and Hoppers are at
war again. And tell the Wizard to make ready for a journey."
</p><p>
"May I come, too,?" asked Betsy. Ozma nodded with a troubled little frown,
and Betsy bustled off importantly. Not many little girls are called upon to
help settle wars and rule a country as wonderful as Oz.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/148.jpg" alt="Glinda reads the book of records"></p>
<p>
The Horners and Hoppers are a quarrelsome and curious folk living in the
Quadling mountains, and soon Ozma, Jack Pumpkinhead, Betsy and the Wizard of
Oz were rattling off at the best speed the Sawhorse could manage. This was
pretty fast, for the little horse, being made of wood and magically brought to
life, never tires and could outrun anything on legs in the fairy Kingdom of
Oz.
</p><p>
But the fact that interests us is that Ozma did not look in the Magic Picture
or see what exciting adventures the Scarecrow and Dorothy really were having!
</p><p>
As for Professor Wogglebug, who had caused all the trouble, he was busily at
work on the twelfth chapter of the Royal Book of Oz, which he had modestly
headed:
</p><p align="center">

<p align="center"><img src="images/151.jpg" alt="Sir Hokus"></p>
<h2><a name="11">CHAPTER 11</a></h2>
<h3>SIR HOKUS OVERCOMETH THE GIANT</h3>
<p>
"I don't believe we'll ever find the way out of this forest."
</p><p>
Dorothy stopped with a discouraged little sigh and leaned against a tree. They
had followed the road for several hours. First it had been fine and wide, but
it had gradually dwindled to a crooked little path that wound crazily in
and out through the trees. Although it was almost noonday, not a ray of sun
penetrated through the dim green depths.
</p><p>
"Methinks," said Sir Hokus, peering into the gloom ahead, "that a great
adventure is at hand."
</p><p>
The Cowardly Lion put back his ears. "What makes you methink so?" he rumbled
anxiously.
</p><p>
"Hark thee!" said Sir Hokus, holding up his finger warningly. From a great
way off sounded a curious thumping. It was coming nearer and nearer.
</p><p>
"Good gracious!" cried Dorothy, catching hold of the Cowardly Lion's mane.
</p><p>
"This is worse than Pokes!"
</p><p>
"Perchance it is a dragon," exulted the Knight, drawing his short sword. "Ah,
how it would refresh me to slay a dragon!"
</p><p>
"I don't relish dragons myself. Scorched my tongue on one once," said the
Cowardly Lion huskily. "But I'll fight with you, brother Hokus. Stand back,
Dorothy dear."
</p><p>
As the thuds grew louder, the Knight fairly danced up and down with
excitement. "Approach, villain!" he roared lustily.
</p><p>
"Approach till I impale thee on my lance. Ah, had I but a horse!"
</p><p>
"I'd let you ride on my back if it weren't for that hard tin suit," said the
Cowardly Lion. "But cheer up, my dear Hokus, your voice is a little
hoarse." Dorothy giggled nervously, then seized hold of a small tree, for
the whole forest was rocking.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/153.jpg" alt="Sir Hokus"></p>
<p>
"How now!" gasped the Knight. There was a terrific quake that threw Sir Hokus
on his face and sent every hair in the lion's mane on end, and then a great
foot came crashing down through the treetops not three paces from the little
party. Before they could even swallow, a giant hand flashed down-ward, jerked
up a handful of trees by the roots, and disappeared, while a voice from
somewhere way above shouted:
</p><p class="poetry">
    What are little humans for?<br>
    To feed the giant Bangladore.<br>

    Broiled or toasted, baked or roasted,<br>
    I smell three or maybe four!
</p><p>
"You hear that?" quavered the Cowardly Lion. Sir Hokus did not answer. His
helmet had been jammed down by his fall, and he was tugging it upward with
both hands. Frightened though Dorothy was, she ran to the Knight's assistance.
</p><p>
"Have at you!" cried Sir Hokus as soon as the opening in his helmet was
opposite his eyes. "Forward!"
</p><p>
"My heart is beating a retreat," gulped the Cowardly Lion, but he bounded
boldly after Sir Hokus.
</p><p>
"Varlet!" hissed the Knight, and raising his sword gave a mighty slash at
the giant's ankle, which was broad as three tree trunks, while the Cowardly
Lion gave a great spring and sank his teeth in the giant's huge leg.
</p><p>
"Ouch!" roared the giant in a voice that shook every leaf in the forest.
"You stop, or I'll tell my father!" With that, he gave a hop that sent Sir
Hokus flying into the treetops, stumbled over a huge rock, and came
crashing to the earth, smashing trees like grass blades. At the giant's
first scream, Dorothy shut her eyes and, putting her hands over her ears,
had run as far and as fast as she could. At the awful crash, she stopped
short, opened her eyes, and stared 'round giddily.
</p><p>
The giant was flat on his back, but as he was stretched as far as four city
blocks, only half of him was visible. The Cowardly Lion still clung to his
leg, and he was gurgling and struggling in a way Dorothy could not understand.
</p><p>
She looked around in a panic for the Knight. Just then, Sir Hokus dropped from
the branch of a tree.
</p><p>
"Uds daggers!" he puffed, looking ruefully at his sword, which had snapped
off at the handle, "'Tis a pretty rogue!"
</p><p>
"Don't you think we'd better run?" shiver Dorothy, thinking of the giant's
song.
</p><p>
"Not while I wear these colors!" exclaimed Sir Hokus, proudly touching
Dorothy's hair ribbon, which still adorned his arm. "Come, my good Lion,
let us dispatch this braggart and saucy monster."
</p><p>
"Father!" screamed the giant, making no attempt to move.
</p><p>
"He seems to be frightened, himself," whispered Dorothy to the Knight. "But
whatever is the matter with the Cowardly Lion?"
</p><p>
At that minute, the Cowardly Lion gave a great jerk and began backing with
his four feet braced. The piece of giant leg that he had hold of stretched
and stretched, and while Sir Hokus and Dorothy stared in amazement, it
snapped off and the Cowardly Lion rolled head over paws.
</p><p>
"Taffy!" roared the Cowardly Lion, sitting up and trying to open his jaws,
which were firmly stuck together.
</p><p>
"Taffy!" At this, Sir Hokus sprang nimbly on the giant's leg, ran up his
chest, and perched bravely on his peppermint collar.
</p><p align="center"><img src="images/156.jpg" alt="Sir Hokus sprang nimbly">
</p><p>
"Surrender, Knave!" he demanded threateningly. Dorothy, seeing she could do
nothing to help the Cowardly Lion, followed. On her way up, she broke off a
tiny piece of his coat and found it most delicious chocolate.
</p><p>
"Why, he's all made of candy!" she cried excitedly.
</p><p>
"Oh, hush!" sobbed the giant, rolling his great sourball eyes. "I'd be eaten
in a minute if it were known."
</p><p>
"You were mighty anxious to eat us a while ago," said Dorothy, looking
longingly at the giant's coat buttons. They seemed to be large marshmallows.
</p><p>
"Go away!" screamed the giant, shaking so that Dorothy slid into his vest
pocket. "No one under forty feet is allowed in this forest!"
</p><p>
Dorothy climbed crossly out of the giant's pocket. "We didn't come because
we wanted to," she assured him, wiping the chocolate off her nose.
</p><p>
"Odds bodikins! I cannot fight a great baby like this," sighed Sir Hokus,
dodging just in time a great, sugary tear that had rolled down the giant's
nose. "He's got to apologize for that song, though."
</p><p>
"Wait!" cried Dorothy suddenly. "I have an idea. If you set us down on the
edge of the forest and give us all your vest buttons for lunch, we won't
tell anyone you're made of candy. We'll let you go," she called loudly, for
the giant had begun to sob again.
</p><p>
"Won't you? Will you?" sniffed the foolish giant.
</p><p>
"Never sing that song again!" commanded the Knight sternly.
</p><p>
"No, Sir," answered the giant meekly. "Did your dog chew much of my leg,
Sir?" Then, before Dorothy or Sir Hokus had time to way a word, they were
snatched up in sticky fingers and next minute were dropped with a thump in
a large field of daisies.
</p><p>
"Oh!" spluttered Dorothy as the giant made off on his taffy legs. "Oh, we've
forgotten the Cowardly Lion!" But at that minute, the giant reappeared, and
the lion was dropped beside them.
</p><p>
"What's this? What's this?" growled the Cowardly Lion, looking around wildly.
</p><p>
"We got him to lift us out of the forest," explained Dorothy. "Have you
swallowed the taffy?" The lion was still dizzy from his ride and only shook
his head feebly.
</p><p>
Sir Hokus sighed and sat heavily down on a large rock. "There is no sort of
honor, methinks, in overcoming a candy giant," he observed, looking
wistfully at the plume still pinned to Dorothy's dress. "Ah, had it but
been a proper fight!"
</p><p>
"You didn't know he was candy. I think you were just splendid." Jumping up,
Dorothy fastened the plume in the Knight's helmet. "And you're talking just
beautifully, more like a Knight every minute," she added with conviction.
Sir Hokus tried not to look pleased.
</p><p>
"Give me a meat enemy! My teeth ache yet! First singing, then candy-leg
pulling! Gr-ugh! What next?" growled the Cowardly Lion.
</p><p>
"Why, lunch, if you feel like eating," said Dorothy, beginning to give out
the vest buttons which the giant had obediently ripped off and left for
them. They <i>were</i> marshmallows, the size of pie plates, and Dorothy and
Sir Hokus found them quite delicious. The Cowardly Lion, however, after a
doubtful sniff and sneeze from the powdered sugar, declined and went off to
find something more to his taste.
</p><p>
"We had better take some of these along," said Dorothy when she and Sir
Hokus had eaten several. "We may need them later."
</p><p>
"Everything is yellow, so we must be in the Winkie Country," announced the
Cowardly Lion, who had just returned from his lunch. "There's a road, too."
</p><p>
"Mayhap it will take us to the jeweled city of your gracious Queen." Sir Hokus
shaded his eyes and stared curiously at the long lane stretching invitingly
ahead of them.
</p><p>
"Well, anyway, we're out of the forest and Pokes, and maybe we'll meet someone
who will tell us about the Scarecrow. Come on!" cried Dorothy gaily. "I think
we're on the right track this time."
</p>

<h2><a name="12">CHAPTER 12</a></h2>
<h3>DOROTHY AND SIR HOKUS COME TO FIX CITY</h3>
<p>
The afternoon went pleasantly for the three travelers. The road was wide and
shady and really seemed a bit familiar. Dorothy rode comfortably on the
Cowardly Lion's back and to pass the time told Sir Hokus all about Oz. He
was particularly interested in the Scarecrow.
</p><p>
"Grammercy! He should be knighted!" he exclaimed, slapping his knee, as
Dorothy told how the clever straw man had helped outwit the Gnome King when
that wicked little rascal had tried to keep them prisoners in his underground
kingdom.
</p><p>
"But, go to! Where is the gallant man now?" The Knight sobered quickly.
"Mayhap in need of a strong arm! Mayhap at the mercy of some terrible
monster!"
</p><p>
"Oh, I hope not!" cried Dorothy, dismayed at so dark a picture. "Why, oh
why, did he bother about his family tree?"
</p><p>
"Trust the Scarecrow to take care of himself," said the Cowardly Lion in a
gruff voice. Nevertheless, he quickened his steps. "The sooner we reach the
Emerald City, the sooner we'll know where he is!"
</p><p>
The country through which they were passing was beautiful, but quite
deserted. About five o'clock, they came to a clear little stream, and after
Dorothy and Sir Hokus had washed their faces and the Cowardly Lion had
taken a little plunge, they all felt refreshed. Later they came to a fine
pear orchard, and as no one was about they helped themselves generously.
</p><p>
The more Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion saw of Sir Hokus, the fonder of him
they grew. He was so kind-hearted and so polite.
</p><p>
"He'll be great company for us back in the Emerald City," whispered the
Cowardly Lion as the Knight went off to get Dorothy a drink from a little
spring. "That is, if he forgets this grammercy, bludgeon stuff."
</p><p>
"I think it sounds lovely," said Dorothy, "and he's remembering more of it all
the time. But I wonder why there are no people here. I do hope we meet some
before night." But no person did they meet. As it grew darker, Sir Hokus'
armor began to creak in a quite frightful manner. Armor is not meant for
walking, and the poor Knight was stiff and tired, but he made no complaint.
</p><p>
"Need oiling, don't you?" asked the Cowardly Lion, peering anxiously at him
through the gloom.
</p><p>
"Joints in my armor a bit rusty," puffed Sir Hokus, easing one foot and then
the other. "Ah, had I my good horse!" He expressively waved a piece of the
giant's button at which he had been nibbling.
</p><p>
"Better climb up behind Dorothy," advised the Cowardly Lion, but Sir Hokus
shook his head, for he knew the lion was tired, too.
</p><p>
"I'll manage famously. This very night I may find me a steed!"
</p><p>
"How?" asked the lion with a yawn.
</p><p>
"If I sleep beneath these trees, I may have a Knight mare," chuckled Sir
Hokus triumphantly.
</p><p>
"Br-rrr!" roared the Cowardly Lion while Dorothy clapped her hands. But they
were not to sleep beneath the trees after all, for a sudden turn in the
road brought them right to the gates of another city. They knew it must be
a city because a huge, lighted sign hung over the gate.
</p><p>
"Fix City," read Dorothy. "What a funny name!"
</p><p>
"Maybe they can fix us up," rumbled the lion, winking at Sir Hokus.
</p><p>
"Perchance we shall hear news of the valiant Scarecrow!" cried the Knight,
and limping forward he thumped on the gate with his mailed fist. Dorothy
and the Cowardly Lion pressed close behind him and waited impatiently for
someone to open the gate.
</p><p>
A bell rang loud back in the town. The next instant, the gates flew open so
suddenly that the three adventurers were flung violently on their faces.
</p><p>
"Out upon them!" blustered Sir Hokus, getting up stiffly and running to help
Dorothy. "What way is this to welcome strangers?" He pulled the little girl
hastily to her feet, then they all ran forward, for the gates were swinging
shut again.
</p><p>
It was almost as light as day, for lanterns were everywhere, but strangely
enough they seemed to dart about like huge fireflies, and Dorothy ducked
involuntarily as a red one bobbed down almost in her face. Then she gasped in
real earnest and caught hold of Sir Hokus.
</p><p>
"Uds daggers!" wheezed the Knight. Two large bushes were running down the
path, and right in front of Dorothy the larger caught the smaller and began
pulling out its leaves.
</p><p>
"Leave off! Leave off!" screamed the little bush.
</p><p>
"That's what I'm doing," said the big bush savagely. "There won't be a leaf
on when I get through with you."
</p><p>
"Unhand him, villain!" cried Sir Hokus, waving his sword at the large bush.
The two bushes looked up in surprise, and when they saw Dorothy, the
Cowardly Lion and Sir Hokus, they fell into each other's branches and burst
into the most uproarious laughter.
</p><p>
"My dear Magnolia, this is rich! Oh, dear fellow, wait till Sit sees this;
he will be convulsed!" Quite forgetting their furious quarrel, the two went
rollicking down the path together, stopping every few minutes to look back
and laugh at the three strangers.
</p><p>
"Is this usual?" asked Sir Hokus, looking quite dazed.
</p><p>
"I never heard of bushes talking or running around, but I confess I'm a few
centuries behind times!"
</p><p>
"Neither did I!" exclaimed Dorothy. "But then&mdash;almost anything's likely to
happen in Oz."
</p><p>
"If these lanterns don't look out something will happen. I'll break 'em to
bits," growled the Cowardly Lion, who had been dodging half a dozen at once.
</p><p>
"How would we look&mdash;out?" sniffed one, flying at Dorothy.
</p><p>
"You could light out&mdash;or go out," giggled the little girl.
</p><p>
"We never go out unless we're put out," cried another, but as the Cowardly
Lion made a few springs, they flew high into the air and began talking
indignantly among themselves. By this time, the three had become accustomed
to the changing lights.
</p><p>
"I wonder where the people are," said Dorothy, peering down a wide avenue.
"There don't seem to be any houses. Oh, look!"
</p><p>
Three tables set for dinner with the most appetizing viands were walking
jauntily down the street, talking fluent china.
</p><p>
"There must be people!" cried Dorothy.
</p><p>
"One dinner for each of us," rumbled the Cowardly Lion, licking his chops.
"Come on!"
</p><p>
"Perchance they will invite us. If we follow the dinners, we'll come to the
diners," said Sir Hokus mildly.
</p><p>
"Right&mdash;as usual." The Cowardly Lion looked embarrassed, for he had intended
pouncing on the tables without further ceremony.
</p><p>
"Hush! Let's go quietly. If they hear us, they may run and upset the dishes,"
warned Dorothy. So the three walked softly after the dinner tables, their
curiosity about the people of Fix growing keener at every step. Several
chairs, a sofa and a clothes tree rushed past them, but as Dorothy said later
to Ozma, after talking bushes, nothing surprised them. The tables turned the
corner at the end of the avenue three abreast, and the sight that greeted
Dorothy and her comrades was strange indeed. Down each side of a long street
as far as they could see stood rows and rows of people. Each one was in the
exact center of a chalked circle, and they were so still that Dorothy thought
they must be statues.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/168.jpg" alt="The inhabitants of Fix City"></p>
<p>
But no sooner had the three tables made their appearance than bells began
ringing furiously all up and down the street, and dinner tables and chairs
came running from every direction. All the inhabitants of Fix City looked
alike. They had large, round heads, broad placid faces, double chins, and no
waists whatever. Their feet were flat and about three times as long as the
longest you have ever seen. The women wore plain Mother Hubbard dresses and
straw sailor hats, and the men gingham suits.
</p><p>
While the three friends were observing all this, the tables had been taking
their places. One stopped before each Fix, and the chairs, after much
bumping and quarreling, placed themselves properly. At a signal from the
Fix in the center, the whole company sat down without so much as moving
their feet. Dorothy, Sir Hokus and the Cowardly Lion had been too
interested to speak, but at this minute a whole flock of the mischievous
lanterns clustered over their heads, and at the sudden blare of light the
whole street stopped eating and stared.
</p><p>
"Oh!" cried the Fix nearest them, pointing with his fork, "Look at the
runabouts!"
</p><p>
"This way, please! This way, please! Don't bark your shins. Don't take any
more steps than you can help!" boomed an important voice from the middle of
the street. So down the center marched the three, feeling&mdash;as the
Cowardly Lion put it&mdash;exactly like a circus.
</p><p>
"Stop! Names, please!" The Fix next to the center put up his knife
commandingly. Sir Hokus stepped forward with a bow:
</p><p>
"Princess Dorothy of Oz, the Cowardly Lion of Oz."
</p><p>
"And Sir Hokus of Pokes," roared the Lion as the Knight modestly stepped
back without announcing himself.
</p><p>
"Sir Pokus of Hoax, Howardly Kion of Boz, and Little Girl Beginning with D,"
bellowed the Fix, "meet His Royal Highness, King Fix It, and the noble
Fixitives."
</p><p>
"Little Girl Beginning with D! That's too long," complained the King, who,
with the exception of his crown, looked like all the rest of them, "I'll
leave out the middle. What do you want, Little With D?"
</p><p>
"My name is Dorothy, and if your Highness could give us some dinner and tell
us something about the Scarecrow and&mdash;"
</p><p>
"One thing at a time, please," said the King reprovingly. "What does Poker
want, and Boz? Have they anything to spend?"
</p><p>
"Only the night, an' it please your Gracious Highness," said Sir Hokus with
his best bow.
</p><p>
"It doesn't please me especially," said the King, taking a sip of water. "And
there! You've brought up another question. How do you want to spend it?"
</p><p>
He folded his hands helplessly on the table and looked appealingly at
the Fix next to him. "How am I to settle all these questions, Sticken?
First they come running around like crazy chairs, and&mdash;"
</p><p>
"You might ring for a settle," suggested Sticken, looking curiously at Sir
Hokus. The King leaned back with a sigh of relief, then touched a bell.
There were at least twenty bells set on a high post at his right hand, and
all of the Fixes seemed to have similar bell posts.
</p><p>
"He's talking perfect nonsense," said Dorothy angrily. The Cowardly Lion
began to roll his eyes ominously.
</p><p>
"Let me handle this, my dear. I'm used to Kings," whispered Sir Hokus. "Most
of 'em talk nonsense. But if he grows wroth, we'll have all the furniture
in the place around our ears. Now just&mdash;"
</p><p>
Bump! Sir Hokus and Dorothy sat down quite suddenly. The settle had arrived
and hit them smartly behind the knees. The Cowardly Lion dodged just in time
and lay down with a growl beside it.
</p><p>
"Now that you're settled," began the King in a resigned voice, "we might try
again. What is your motto?"
</p><p>
This took even Sir Hokus by surprise, but before he could answer, the King
snapped out:
</p><p>
"Come late and stay early! How's that?"
</p><p>
"Very good," said Sir Hokus with a wink at Dorothy.
</p><p>
"Next time, don't come at all," mumbled Sticken Plaster, his mouth full of
biscuit.
</p><p>
"And you wanted?" the King asked uneasily.
</p><p>
"Dinner for three," said the Knight promptly and with another bow.
</p><p>
"Now that's talking." The King looked admiringly at Sir Hokus. "This Little
With D had matters all tangled up. One time at a thing! That's my motto!"
</p><p>
Leaning over, the King pressed another button. By this time, the Fixes had
lost interest in the visitors and went calmly on with their dinners. Three
tables came pattering up, and the settle drew itself up of its own accord.
Dorothy placed the Cowardly Lion's dinner on the ground, and then she and
Sir Hokus enjoyed the first good meal they had had since they left Pokes.
They were gradually becoming used to their strange surroundings.
</p><p>
"You ask him about the Scarecrow," begged Dorothy. Everybody had finished,
and the tables were withdrawing in orderly groups. The King was leaning
sleepily back in his chair.
</p><p>
"Ahem," began the Knight, rising stiffly, "has your Majesty seen aught of a
noble Scarecrow? And could your Supreme Fixity tell us aught&mdash;"
</p><p>
The King's eyes opened. "You're out of turn," he interrupted crossly. "We're
only to the second question. How will you spend the night?"
</p><p>
"In sleep," answered Sir Hokus promptly, "if your Majesty permits."
</p><p>
"I do," said the King solemnly. "That gets me out of entertaining. Early to
bed and late to rise, that's my motto. Next! It's your turn," he added
irritably as Sir Hokus did not immediately answer.
</p><p>
"Have you seen aught of the noble Scarecrow?" asked Sir Hokus, and all of
them waited anxiously for the King's reply.
</p><p>
"I don't know about <i>the</i> Scarecrow. I've seen <i>a</i> Scarecrow, and a sensible chap
he was, hanging still like a reasonable person and letting chairs and tables
chase themselves 'round."
</p><p>
"Where was he?" asked Sir Hokus in great agitation.
</p><p>
"In a picture," said the King. "Wait, I'll ring for it."
</p><p>
"No use," said the Knight in a disappointed voice. "We're looking for a man."
</p><p>
"Would you mind telling me why you are all so still, and why all your
furniture runs around?" asked Dorothy, who was growing a little restless.
</p><p>
"You forget where you are, and you're out of turn. But I'll overlook it this
once," said the King. "Have you ever noticed, Little With D, that furniture
lasts longer than people?"
</p><p>
"Why, yes," admitted Dorothy.
</p><p>
"Well, there you are!" King Fix Sit folded his hands and regarded her
complacently. "Here we manage things better. We stand still and let the
furniture run around and wear itself out. How does it strike you?"
</p><p>
"It seem sensible," acknowledged Dorothy. "But don't you ever grow tired of
standing still?"
</p><p>
"I've heard of growing hair and flowers and corn, but never of growing
tired. What is it?" asked Sticken Plaster, leaning toward Dorothy.
</p><p>
"I think she's talked enough," said the King, closing his eyes.
</p><p>
Sir Hokus had been staring anxiously at the King for some time. Now he came
close to the monarch's side, and standing on tiptoe whispered hoarsely:
"Hast any dragons here?"
</p><p>
"Did you say wagons?" asked the King, opening his eyes with a terrible yawn.
</p><p>
"Dragons!" hissed the Knight.
</p><p>
"Never heard of 'em," said the King. The Cowardly Lion chuckled behind his
whiskers, and Sir Hokus in great confusion stepped back.
</p><p>
"What time is it?" demanded the King suddenly. He touched a bell, and next
minute a whole company of clocks came running down the street. The big ones
pushed the little ones, and a grandfather clock ran so fast that it tripped
over a cobblestone and fell on its face, which cracked all the way across.
</p><p>
"You've plenty of time; why don't you take it?" called the King angrily, while
two clothes trees helped the clock to its feet.
</p><p>
"They're all different," giggled Dorothy, nudging the Cowardly Lion. Some
pointed to eight o'clock, some to nine, and others to half past ten.
</p><p>
"Why shouldn't they be different?" asked Sticken haughtily. "Some run faster
than others!"
</p><p>
"Pass the time, please," said the King, looking hard at Dorothy.
</p><p>
"The lazy lump!" growled the Cowardly Lion. But Dorothy picked up the
nearest little clock and handed it to King Fix Sit.
</p><p>
"I thought so," yawned the King, pointing at the clock. At this, everybody
began ringing bells till Dorothy was obliged to cover her ears. In an
instant, the whole street was filled with beds, "rolling up just as if they
were taxis," laughed Dorothy to Sir Hokus. The Knight smiled faintly, but
as he had never seen a taxi, he could not appreciate Dorothy's remark.
</p><p>
"Here come your beds," said the King shortly. "Tell them to take you around
the corner. I can't abide snoring."
</p><p>
"I don't snore, thank you," said Dorothy angrily, but the King had stepped
into his bed and drawn the curtains tight.
</p><p>
"We might as well go to bed, I 'spose," said the little girl. "I'm so tired!"
</p><p>
The three beds were swaying restlessly in the middle of the street. They
were tall, four-post affairs with heavy chintz hangings. Dorothy chose the
blue one, and Sir Hokus lifted her up carefully and then went off to catch
his bed, which had gotten into an argument with a lamppost. When he spoke
to it sharply, it left off and came trotting over to him. The Cowardly
Lion, contrary to his usual custom, leaped into his bed, and soon the three
four-posters were walking quietly down the street, evidently following the
King's instructions.
</p><p>
Dorothy slipped off her shoes and dress and nestled comfortably down among the
soft covers. "Just like sleeping in a train," she thought drowsily. "What a
lot I shall have to tell the Scarecrow and Ozma when I get home."
</p><p>
"Good night!" said the bed politely.
</p><p>
"Good night!" said Dorothy, too nearly asleep to even think it strange for a
bed to talk. "Good night!"
</p>

<h2><a name="13">CHAPTER 13</a></h2>
<h3>DANCING BEDS AND THE ROADS THAT UNROLLED</h3>
<p>
"It must be a shipwreck," thought Dorothy, sitting up in alarm. She seemed
to be tossing about wildly.
</p><p>
"Time for little girls to get up," grumbled a harsh voice that seemed to
come from the pillows.
</p><p>
Dorothy rubbed her eyes. One of the bedposts was addressing her, and the big
four-poster itself was dancing a regular jig.
</p><p>
"Oh, stop!" cried Dorothy, holding on to the post to keep from bouncing out.
</p><p>
"Can't you see I'm awake?"
</p><p>
"Well, I go off duty now, and you'll have to hurry," said the bed sulkily.
"I'm due at the lecture at nine."
</p><p>
"Lecture?" gasped Dorothy.
</p><p>
"What's so queer about that?" demanded the bed coldly. "I've got to keep
well posted, haven't I? I belong to a polished set, I do. Hurry up, little
girl, or I'll throw you out."
</p><p>
"I'm glad my bed doesn't talk to me in this impertinent fashion," thought
Dorothy, slipping into her dress and combing her hair with her side comb.
"Imagine being ordered about by a bed! I wonder if Sir Hokus is up."
Parting the curtains, she jumped down, and the bed, without even saying
goodbye, took itself off.
</p><p>
Sir Hokus was sitting on a stile, polishing his armor with a pillowslip he had
taken from his bed, and the Cowardly Lion was lying beside him lazily thumping
his tail and making fun of the passing furniture.
</p><p>
"Have you had breakfast?" asked Dorothy, joining her friends.
</p><p>
"We were waiting for your Ladyship," chuckled the Cowardly Lion. "Would you
mind ordering two for me, Hokus? I find one quite insufficient."
</p><p>
Sir Hokus threw away the pillowslip, and talking cheerfully they walked
toward King Fix Sit's circle. The beds had been replaced by breakfast
tables, and the whole street was eating busily.
</p><p>
"Good morning, King," said Sir Hokus. "Four breakfasts, please."
</p><p>
The king rang a bell four times without looking up from his oatmeal. Seeing
that he did not wish to be disturbed, the three waited quietly for their
tables.
</p><p>
"In some ways," said Dorothy, contentedly munching a hot roll, "in
some ways this is a very comfortable place."
</p><p>
"In sooth 'tis that," mumbled Sir Hokus, his mouth full of baked apple. As
for the Cowardly Lion, he finished his two breakfasts in no time. "And
now," said Sir Hokus as the tables walked off, "let us continue our quest.
Could'st tell us the way to the Emerald City, my good King Fix?"
</p><p>
"If you go, go away. And if you stay, stay away. That's my motto," answered
King Fix shortly. "I can't have people running around here like common
furniture," he added in a grieved voice. All the Fix Its nodded vigorously.
</p><p>
"Let them take their stand or their departure," said Sticken Plaster firmly.
</p><p>
The King felt in his pocket and brought out three pieces of chalk. "Go to
the end of the street. Choose a place and draw your circle. In five minutes
you will find it impossible to move out of the circle, and you will be
saved all this unnecessary motion."
</p><p>
"But we don't want to come to a standstill," objected Dorothy.
</p><p>
"No, by my good sword!" spluttered the Knight, glaring around nervously.
Then, seeing the King looked displeased, he made a low bow. "If your
Highness could graciously direct us out of the city&mdash;"
</p><p>
"Buy a piece of road and go where it takes you," snapped the King.
</p><p>
Seeing no more was to be got out of him, they started down the long street.
</p><p>
"I wonder what they do when it rains?" said Dorothy, looking curiously at
the solemn rows of people.
</p><p>
"Call for roofs, silly!" snapped a Fix, staring at her rudely. "If you would
spend your time thinking instead of walking, you'd know more."
</p><p>
"Go to, and swallow a gooseberry!" roared the Knight, waving his sword at
the Fix, and Dorothy, fearing an encounter, begged him to come on, which he
did&mdash;though with many backward glances.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/183.jpg" alt="Fix City"></p>
<p>
Fix City seemed to consist of one long street, and they had soon come to the
very end.
</p><p>
"Uds daggers!" gasped Sir Hokus.
</p><p>
"Great palm trees," roared the Cowardly Lion.
</p><p>
As for Dorothy, she could do nothing but stare. The street ended surely
enough, and beyond there was nothing at all. That is, nothing but air.
</p><p>
"Well," said the Cowardly Lion, backing a few paces, "this is a pretty fix."
</p><p>
"Glad you like it," said a wheezy voice. The three travelers turned in
surprise. A huge Fix was regarding them with interest. His circle, which
was the last in the row, was about twenty times as large as the other
circles, and on the edge stood a big sign:'
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/184.jpg" alt="Road Shop"></p>
<p>
"Don't you remember, the King said something about buying a road," said
Dorothy in an excited undertone to the Knight.
</p><p>
"Can'st direct us to a road, my good man?" asked Sir Hokus with a bow.
The Fix jerked his thumb back at the sign. "What kind of a road to you
want?" he asked hoarsely.
</p><p>
"A road that will take us back to the Emerald City, please," said Dorothy.
</p><p>
"I can't guarantee anything like that," declared the Fix, shaking his head.
</p><p>
"Our roads go where they please, and you'll have to go where they take you.
Do you want to go on or off?"
</p><p>
"On," shivered the Cowardly Lion, looking with a shudder over the precipice
at the end of the street.
</p><p>
"What kind of a road will you have? Make up your minds, please. I am busy."
</p><p>
"What kind of roads have you?" asked Dorothy timidly. It was her first
experience at buying roads, and she felt a bit perplexed.
</p><p>
"Sunny, shady, straight, crooked, and cross-roads," snapped the Fix.
</p><p>
"We wouldn't want a cross one," said Dorothy positively. "Have you any with
trees at both sides and water at the end?"
</p><p>
"How many yards?" asked the Fix, taking a pair of shears as large as himself
off a long counter beside him.
</p><p>
"Five miles," said Sir Hokus as Dorothy looked confused. "That ought to take
us somewhere!"
</p><p>
The Fix rang one of the bells in the counter. The next minute, a big trap door
in the ground opened, and a perfectly huge roll bounced out at his feet.
</p><p>
"Get on," commanded the Fix in such a sharp tone that the three jumped to
obey. Holding fast to Sir Hokus, Dorothy stepped on the piece of road that had
already unrolled. The Cowardly Lion, looking very anxious, followed. No sooner
had they done so than the road gave a terrific leap forward that stretched the
three flat upon their backs and started unwinding from its spool at a
terrifying speed. As it unrolled, tall trees snapped erect on each side and began
laughing derisively at the three travelers huddled together in the middle.
</p><p>
"G-g-glad we only took five miles," stuttered Dorothy to the Knight, whose
armor was rattling like a Ford.
</p><p>
The Cowardly Lion had wound his tail around a tree and dug his claws into the
road, for he had no intention of falling off into nothingness. As for the
road, it snapped along at about a mile a minute, and before they had time to
grow accustomed to this singular mode of travel, it gave a final jump that
sent them circling into the air, and began rapidly winding itself up.
</p><p>
Down, down, down whirled Dorothy, falling with a resounding splash into a
broad stream of water. Then down, down, down again, almost to the bottom.
</p><p align="center"><img src="images/186.jpg" alt="Down down down">
</p><p>
"Help!" screamed Dorothy as her head rose above water, and she began striking
out feebly. But the fall through the air had taken all her breath.
</p><p>
"What do you want?" A thin, neat little man was watching her anxiously from
the bank, making careful notes in a book that he held in one hand.
</p><p>
"Help! Save me!" choked Dorothy, feeling herself going down in the muddy
stream again.
</p><p>
"Wait! I'll look it up under the 'H's," called the little man, making a
trumpet of his hands. "Are you an island? An island is a body of land entirely
surrounded by water, but this seems to be a some-body," Dorothy heard him
mutter as he whipped over several pages of his book. "Sorry," he called back,
shaking his head slowly, "but this is the wrong day. I only save lives on
Monday."
</p><p>
"Stand aside, Mem, you villain!" A second little man exactly like the first
except that he was exceedingly untidy plunged into the stream.
</p><p>
"It's no use," thought Dorothy, closing her eyes, for he had jumped in far
below the spot where she had fallen and was making no progress whatever.
The waters rushed over her head the second time. Then she felt herself
being dragged upward.
</p><p>
When she opened her eyes, the Cowardly Lion was standing over her. "Are you
all right?" he rumbled anxiously. "I came as soon as I could. Fell in way
upstream. Seen Hokus?"
</p><p>
"Oh, he'll drown," cried Dorothy, forgetting her own narrow escape. "He
can't swim in that heavy armor!"
</p><p>
"Never fear, I'll get him," puffed the Cowardly Lion, and without waiting to
catch his breath he plunged back into the stream. The little man who only
saved lives on Monday now approached timidly. "I'd like to get a statement
from you, if you don't mind. It might help me in the future."
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/188.jpg" alt="The Cowardly Lion fell in way upstream"></p>
<p>
"You might have helped me in the present," said Dorothy, wringing out her
dress. "You ought to be ashamed of yourself."
</p><p>
"I'll make a note of that," said the little man earnestly. "But how did you
feel when you went down?" He waited, his pencil poised over the little book.
</p><p>
"Go away," cried Dorothy in disgust.
</p><p>
"But my dear young lady&mdash;"
</p><p>
"I'm not your dear young lady. Oh, dear, why doesn't the Cowardly Lion come
back?"
</p><p>
"Go away, Mem." The second little man, dripping wet, came up hurriedly.
</p><p>
"I was only trying to get a little information," grumbled Mem sulkily.
</p><p>
"I'm sorry I couldn't swim faster," said the wet little man, approaching
Dorothy apologetically.
</p><p>
"Well, thank you for trying," said Dorothy. "Is he your brother? And could
you tell me where you are? You're dressed in yellow, so I 'spose it must be
somewhere in the Winkie Country."
</p><p>
"Right in both cases," chuckled the little fellow. "My name is Ran and his
name is Memo." He jerked his thumb at the retiring twin. "Randum and Memo&mdash;
see?"
</p><p>
"I think I do," said Dorothy, half closing her eyes. "Is that why he's
always taking notes?"
</p><p>
"Exactly," said Ran. "I do everything at Random, and he does everything at
memorandum."
</p><p>
"It must be rather confusing," said Dorothy. Then as she caught sight of the
Cowardly Lion dragging Sir Hokus, she jumped up excitedly. Ran, however,
took one look at the huge beast and then fled, calling for Mem at the top
of his voice. And that is the last Dorothy saw of these singular twins.
</p><p>
The Lion dropped Sir Hokus in a limp heap. When Dorothy unfastened his armor,
gallons of water rushed out.
</p><p>
"Sho good of&mdash;of&mdash;you," choked the poor Knight, trying to straighten up.
</p><p>
"Save your breath, old fellow," said the Cowardly Lion, regarding him
affectionately.
</p><p>
"Oh, why did I ask for water on the end of the road?" sighed Dorothy. "But,
anyway, we're in some part of the Winkie Country."
</p><p>
Sir Hokus, though still spluttering, was beginning to revive. "Yon noble
bheast shall be knighted. Uds daggers! That's the shecond time he's shaved
my life!" Rising unsteadily, he tottered over to the Lion and struck him a
sharp blow on the shoulder. "Rishe, Shir Cowardly Lion," he cried hoarsely,
and fell headlong, and before Dorothy or the lion had recovered from their
surprise he was fast asleep, mumbling happily of dragons and bludgeons.
</p><p>
"We'll have to wait till he gets rested," said Dorothy. "And until I get
dry." She began running up and down, then stopped suddenly before the Lion.
</p><p>
"And there's something else for Professor Wogglebug to put in his book, Sir
Cowardly Lion."
</p><p>
"Oh, that!" mumbled the Cowardly Lion, looking terribly embarrassed. "Whoever
heard of a Cowardly Knight? Nonsense!"
</p><p>
"No, it isn't nonsense," said Dorothy stoutly. "You're a knight from now on.
Won't the Scarecrow be pleased?"
</p><p>
"If we ever find him," sighed the Lion, settling himself beside Sir Hokus.
</p><p>
"We will," said Dorothy gaily. "I just feel it."
</p>

<h2><a name="14">CHAPTER 14</a></h2>
<h3>SONS AND GRANDSONS GREET THE SCARECROW</h3>

<p>
Although the Scarecrow had been on Silver Island only a few days, he had
already instituted many reforms, and thanks to his cleverness the people
were more prosperous than ever before. Cheers greeted him wherever he went,
and even old Chew Chew was more agreeable and no longer made bitter remarks
to Happy Toko. The Scarecrow himself, however, had four new wrinkles and
was exceedingly melancholy. He missed the carefree life in Oz, and every
minute that he was not ruling the island he was thinking about his old home
and dear, jolly comrades in the Emerald City.
</p><p>
"I almost hope they will look in the Magic Picture and wish me back again,"
he mused pensively. "But it is my duty to stay here. I have a family to
support." So he resolved to put the best face he could on the matter, and
Happy Toko did his utmost to cheer up his royal master. The second morning
after the great victory, he came running into the silver throne room in a
great state of excitement.
</p><p>
"The honorable Offspring have arriven!" announced Happy, turning a
somersault. "Come, ancient and amiable Sir, and gaze upon your sons and
grandsons!" The Scarecrow sprang joyously from his silver throne, upsetting
a bowl of silver fish and three silver vases. At last a real family! Ever
since his arrival, the three Princes and their fifteen little sons had been
cruising on the royal pleasure barge, so that the Scarecrow had not caught
a glimpse of them.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/195.jpg" alt="&quot;This is the happiest
moment of my life!&quot;"></p>
<p>
"This is the happiest moment of my life!" he exclaimed, clasping his yellow
gloves and watching the door intently. Happy looked a little uneasy, for he
knew the three Princes to be exceedingly haughty and overbearing, but he
said nothing, and next minute the Scarecrow's family stepped solemnly into
the royal presence.
</p><p>
"Children!" cried the Scarecrow, and with his usual impetuousness rushed
forward and flung his arms around the first richly clad Prince.
</p><p>
"Take care! Take care, ancient and honorable papa!" cried the young Silverman,
backing away. "Such excitement is not good for one of your advanced years." He
drew himself away firmly and, adjusting a huge pair of silver spectacles,
regarded the Scarecrow attentively. "Ah, how you have changed!"
</p><p>
"He looks very feeble, Too Fang, but may he live long to rule this flowery
island and our humble selves!" said the second Prince, bowing stiffly.
</p><p>
"Do you not find the affairs of state fatiguing, darling papa?" inquired the
third Prince, fingering a jeweled chain that hung around his neck.
</p><p>
"I, as your eldest son, shall be delighted to relieve you should you wish to
retire. Get back ten paces, you!" he roared at Happy Toko.
</p><p>
The poor Scarecrow had been so taken aback by this cool reception that he
just stared in disbelief.
</p><p>
"If the three honorable Princes will retire themselves, I will speak with my
grandsons," he said dryly, bowing in his most royal manner. The three Princes
exchanged startled glances. Then, with three low salaams, they retired
backward from the hall.
</p><p>
"And now, my dears&mdash;!" The Scarecrow looked wistfully at his fifteen
silken-clad little grandsons. Their silver hair, plaited tightly into little
queues, stood out stiffly on each side of their heads and gave them a very
curious appearance. At his first word, the fifteen fell dutifully on their
noses. As soon as they were right side up, the Scarecrow, beginning at the
end of the row, addressed a joking question to each in his most approved
Oz style. But over they went again, and answered merely:
</p><p align="center"><img src="images/197.jpg" alt="The fifteen grandsons">
</p><p>
"Yes, gracious Grand-papapapah!" or "No honorable Grandpapapapah!" And the
constant bobbing up and down and papahing so confused the poor Scarecrow that
he nearly gave up the conversation.
</p><p>
"It's no use trying to talk to these children," he wailed in disgust, "they're
so solemn. Don't you ever laugh?" he cried in exasperation, for he had told
them stories that would have sent the Oz youngsters into hysterics.
</p><p>
"It is not permissible for a Prince to laugh at the remarks of his honorable
grandparent," whispered Happy Toko, while the fifteen little Princes banged
their heads solemnly on the floor.
</p><p>
"Honorable fiddlesticks!" exclaimed the Scarecrow, slumping back on his
throne. "Bring cushions." Happy Toko ran off nimbly, and soon the fifteen
little Princes were seated in a circle at the Scarecrow's feet. "To prevent
prostrations," said the Scarecrow.
</p><p>
"Yes, old Grandpapapapapah!" chorused the Princes, bending over as far as
they could.
</p><p>
"Wait!" said the Scarecrow hastily, "I'll tell you a story. Once upon a
time, to a beautiful country called Oz, which is surrounded on all sides by
a deadly desert, there came a little girl named Dorothy. A terrible gale&mdash;
Well, what's the matter now?" The Scarecrow stopped short, for the oldest
Prince had jerked a book out of his sleeve and was flipping over the pages
industriously.
</p><p>
"It is not on the map, great Grand papapapah," he announced solemnly, and
all of the other little Princes shook their heads and said dully, "Not on
the map."
</p><p>
"Not on the map&mdash;Oz? Of course it's not. Do you suppose we want all the
humans in creation coming there?" Calming down, the Scarecrow tried to
continue his story, but every time he mentioned Oz, the little Princes
shook their heads stubbornly and whispered, "Not on the map," till the
usually good-tempered Scarecrow flew into perfect passion.
</p><p>
"Not on the map, you little villains!" he screamed, forgetting they were his
grandsons. "What difference does that make? Are your heads solid silver?"
</p><p>
"We do not believe in Oz," announced the oldest Prince serenely. "There is
no such place."
</p><p>
"No such place as Oz&mdash;Happy, do you hear that?" The Scarecrow's voice fairly
crackled with indignation. "Why, I thought everybody believed in Oz!"
</p><p>
"Perhaps your Highness can convince them later," suggested the Imperial
Punster. "This way, offspring." His Master, he felt, had had enough family
for one day. So the fifteen little Princes, with fifteen stiff little bows,
took themselves back to the royal nursery. As for the Scarecrow, he paced
disconsolately up and down his magnificent throne room, tripping over his
kimona at every other step.
</p><p>
"You're a good boy, Tappy," said the Scarecrow as Happy returned, "but I tell
you being a grandparent is not what I thought it would be. Did you hear them
tell me right to my face they did not believe in Oz? And my sons&mdash;ugh!"
</p><p>
"Fault of their bringing up," said Happy Toko comfortingly. "If your serene
Highness would just tell me more of that illustrious country!" Happy
knew that nothing cheered the Scarecrow like talking of Oz, and to tell the
truth Happy himself never tired of the Scarecrow's marvelous stories. So
the two slipped quietly into the palace gardens, and the Scarecrow related
for the fourteenth time the story of his discovery by Dorothy and the story
of Ozma, and almost forgot that he was an Emperor.
</p><p>
"Your Highness knows the history of Oz by heart," said Happy admiringly as
the Scarecrow paused.
</p><p>
"I couldn't do that," said the Scarecrow gently, "for you see, Happy, I have
no heart."
</p><p>
"Then I wish we all had none!" exclaimed Happy Toko, rolling up his eyes.
The Scarecrow looked embarrassed, so the little Punster threw back his head
and sang a song he had been making up while the Scarecrow had been telling
his stories:
</p><p class="poetry">
    The Scarecrow was standing alone in a field,<br>
    Inviting the crows to keep off,<br>
    When the straw in his chest began tickling his vest<br>
    And he couldn't resist a loud cough.
</p><p class="poetry">
    The noise that was heard so surprised ev'ry bird,<br>
    that the flock flew away in a fright,<br>
    But the Scarecrow looked pleased, and he said "If I'd sneezed<br>

    It wouldn't have been so polite."
</p><p>
"Ho!" roared the Scarecrow, "You're almost as good at making verses as
Scraps, Write that down for me, Tappy. I'd like to show it to her."
</p><p>
"Hush!" whispered Happy, holding up his finger warningly. The Scarecrow turned
so suddenly that the silver pigtail pinned to the back of his hat wound itself
tightly around his neck. No wonder! On the other side of the hedge the three
Princes were walking up and down, conversing in indignant whispers.
</p><p>
"What a horrible shape our honorable Papa has reappeared in. I hear that it
never wears out," muttered one. "He may continue just as he is for years and
years. How am I ever to succeed him, I'd like to know. Why, he may outlive us
all!"
</p><p>
"We might throw him into the silver river," said the second hopefully.
</p><p>
"No use," choked the third. "I was just talking to the Imperial Soothsayer,
and he tells me that no one from this miserable Kingdom of Oz can be
destroyed. But I have a plan. Incline your Royal ears&mdash;listen." The
voices dropped to such a low whisper that neither Happy nor the Scarecrow
could hear one word.
</p><p>
"Treason!" spluttered Happy, making ready to spring through the hedge, but
the Scarecrow seized him by the arm and drew him away.
</p><p>
"I don't believe they like their poor papa," exclaimed the Scarecrow when
they were safely back in the throne room. "I'm feeling older than a
Kinkajou. Ah, Happy Oko, why did I ever slide down my family tree? It has
brought me nothing but unhappiness."
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="images/203.jpg" alt="The Plotting Princes"></p>


<h2><a name="15">CHAPTER 15</a></h2>
<h3>THE THREE PRINCES PLOT TO UNDO THE EMPEROR</h3>

<p>
"Let me help your Imperial Serenity!"
</p><p>
"Bring a cane!"
</p><p>
"Carefully, now!"
</p><p>
The three royal Princes, with every show of affection, were supporting the
Scarecrow to the silver bench in the garden where he usually sat during
luncheon.
</p><p>
"Are you quite comfortable?" asked the elder. "Here, Happy, you rogue, fetch
a scarf for his Imperial Highness. You must be careful, dear Papa Scarecrow.
At your age, drafts are dangerous." The rascally Prince wound the scarf about
the Scarecrow's neck.
</p><p>
"What do you suppose they are up to?" asked the Scarecrow, staring after the
three suspiciously. "Why this sudden devotion? It upsets my Imperial Serenity
a lot."
</p><p>
"Trying to make you feel old," grumbled Happy. Several hours had passed
since they had overheard the conversation in the garden. The Scarecrow had
decided to watch his sons closely and fall in with any plan they suggested
so they would suspect nothing. Then, when the time came, he would act. Just
what he would do he did not know, but his excellent brains would not, he
felt sure, desert him. Happy Toko sat as close to the Scarecrow as he could
and scowled terribly whenever the Princes approached, which was every
minute or so during the afternoon.
</p><p>
"How is the Scarecrow's celestial old head?"
</p><p>
"Does he suffer from honorable gout?"
</p><p>
"Should they fetch the Imperial Doctor?"
</p><p>
The Scarecrow, who had never thought of age in his whole straw life, became
extremely nervous.
</p><p>
Was he really old? Did his head ache? When no one was looking, he felt himself
carefully all over. Then something of his old time Oz spirit returned. Seizing
the cushion that his eldest son was placing at his back, he hurled it over his
head. Leaping from his throne, he began turning handsprings in a careless and
sprightly manner.
</p><p>
"Don't you worry about your honorable old papa," chuckled the Scarecrow,
winking at Happy Toko. "He's good for a couple of centuries!"
</p><p>
The three Princes stared sourly at this exhibition of youth.
</p><p>
"But your heart," objected the eldest Prince.
</p><p>
"Have none," laughed the Scarecrow. Snatching off the silver cord from
around his waist, he began skipping rope up and down the hall. The Princes,
tapping their foreheads significantly, retired, and the Scarecrow, throwing
his arm around Happy Toko, began whispering in his ear. He had a plan
himself. They would see!
</p>
<p align="center">    *    *    *    *    *</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, off in his dark cave in one of the silver mountains, the Grand
Gheewizard of the Silver Island was stirring a huge kettle of magic. Every few
moments he paused to read out of a great yellow book that he had propped up on
the mantle. The fire in the huge grate leaped fiercely under the big, black
pot, and the sputtering candles on each side of the book sent creepy shadows
into the dark cave. Dark chests, books, bundles of herbs, and heaps of gold
and silver were everywhere. Whenever the Gheewizard turned his back, a
rheumatic silver-scaled old dragon would crawl toward the fire and swallow a
mouthful of coals, until the old Gheewizard caught him in the act and chained
him to a ring in the corner of the cave.
</p><p>
"Be patient, little joy of my heart! Our fortune is about to be made,"
hissed the wizened little man, waving a long iron spoon at the dragon. "You
shall have a bucket of red-hot coals every hour and I a silver cap with a
tassel. Have not the Royal Princes promised it?" The dragon shuffled about
and finally went to sleep, smoking sulkily.
</p><p>
"Is it finished, son of a yellow dog?" Through the narrow opening of the
cave, the youngest Prince stuck his head.
</p><p>
"I am working as fast as I can, Honorable Prince, but the elixir must boil
yet one more night. Tomorrow, when the sun shines on the first bar of your
celestial window, come, and all will be ready."
</p><p>
"Are you sure you have found it?" asked the Prince, withdrawing his head,
for the smoking dragon and steam from the kettle made him cough.
</p><p>
"Quite sure," wheezed the Grand Gheewizard, and fell to stirring the kettle
with all his might.
</p><p align="center">
    *    *    *    *    *
</p><p>
The Scarecrow, although busy with trials in the great courtroom of the
palace, felt that something unusual was in the air. The Princes kept
nodding to one another, and the Grand Chew Chew and General Mugwump had
their heads together at every opportunity.
</p><p>
"Something's going to happen, Tappy. I feel it in my straw," whispered the
Scarecrow as he finished trying the last case. At that very minute, the
Grand Chew Chew arose and held up his hand for silence. Everybody paused in
their way to the exits and looked with surprise at the old Silverman.
</p><p>
"I have to announce," said the Grand Chew Chew in a solemn voice, "that the
Great and Imperial Chang Wang Woe will tomorrow be restored to his own
rightful shape. The Grand Gheewizard of the realm has discovered a magic
formula to break the enchantment and free him from this distressing
Scarecrow body. Behold for the last the Scarecrow of Oz. Tomorrow he will
be our old and glorious Emperor!"
</p><p>
"Old and glorious?" gasped the Scarecrow, nearly falling from his throne.
</p><p>
"Tappy! I forgot to lock up the wizards. Great Cornstarch! Tomorrow I will
be eighty-five years old."
</p><p>
Such cheers greeted the Grand Chew Chew's announcement that no one even
noticed the Scarecrow's distress.
</p><p>
"I, also, have an announcement!" cried the eldest Prince, standing up proudly.
"To make the celebration of my royal Papa's restoration complete, we have
chosen the lovely and charming Orange Blossom for his bride."
</p><p>
"Bride!" gulped the Scarecrow. "But I do not approve of second marriages.
I refuse to&mdash;"
</p><p>
No one paid the slightest attention to the Scarecrow's remarks.
</p><p>
"Hold my hand, Tappy," sighed the Scarecrow weakly. "It may be your last
chance." Then he sat up and stared in good earnest, for the Prince was leading
forward a tall, richly clad lady.
</p><p>
"Orange Blossom!" muttered the Scarecrow under his breath. "He means Lemon
Peel! Silver grandmother, Tappy!" Orange Blossom was a cross-looking Princess
of seventy-five, at least.
</p><p>
"She is a sister of the King of the Golden Islands," whispered General
Mugwump. "Of a richness surpassing your own. Let me felicitate your Highness."
</p><p>
"Fan me, Tappy! Fan me!" gasped the Scarecrow. Then he straightened himself
suddenly. The time had come for action. He would say nothing to anyone, but
that night he would escape and try to find his way back to Oz, family or no
family! He bowed graciously to Princess Orange Blossom, to the Grand Chew
Chew, and to his sons.
</p><p>
"Let everything be made ready for the ceremony, and may tomorrow indeed bring
me to myself," he repeated solemnly. Nothing was talked of that evening but
the Emperor's impending marriage and the Grand Gheewizard's discovery. The
Scarecrow seemed the least excited person in the palace. Sitting on his
throne, he pretended to read the Royal Silver Journal, but he was really
waiting impatiently for the courtiers to retire. Finally, when the last one
had bowed himself out and only Happy Toko remained in the throne room, the
Scarecrow began making his plans.
</p><p>
"It's no use, Tappy," said he, tying up a few little trinkets for Dorothy in
a silk handkerchief, "I'd rather be straw than meat. I'd rather be a plain
Scarecrow in Oz than Emperor of the Earth! They may be my sons, but all
they want is my death. I'm going back to my old friends. I'd rather&mdash;". He
got no farther. A huge slave seized him suddenly from behind, while another
caught Happy Toko around his fat little waist.
</p><p>
"Tie them fast," said the eldest Prince, smiling wickedly at the Scarecrow.
"Here, tie him to the beanstalk. Merely a part of the Grand Gheewizard's
formula," he exclaimed maliciously as the struggling Scarecrow was bound
securely to his family tree. "Good night, dear papa Scarecrow. Tomorrow you
will be your old self again, and in a few short years <i>I</i> will be Emperor
of the Silver Islands!"
</p><p>
"This rather upsets our plans, eh Tappy?" wheezed the Scarecrow after a
struggle with his bonds.
</p><p>
"Pigs! Weasels!" choked Tappy. "What are we to do?"
</p><p>
"Alas!" groaned the Scarecrow. "Tomorrow there will be no Scarecrow in Oz.
What will Dorothy and Ozma think? And once I am changed into my old
Imperial self, I can never make the journey to the Emerald City. Eighty-six
is too old for traveling."
</p><p>
"Has your Majesty forgotten the wonderful brains given to you by the Wizard
of Oz?"
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/211.jpg" alt="Happy and the Scarecrow are in a bad situation"></p>
<p>
"I had&mdash;for a moment," confessed the Scarecrow. "Be quiet, Tappy, while I
think." Pressing his head against the magic beanpole, the Scarecrow thought
and thought, harder than he had ever done in the course of his adventurous
life, and in the great, silent hall Happy Toko struggled to set himself free.

<h2><a name="16">CHAPTER 16</a></h2>
<h3>DOROTHY AND HER GUARDIANS MEET NEW FRIENDS</h3>

<p>
While all these exciting things were happening to the poor Scarecrow,
Dorothy, Sir Hokus and the Cowardly Lion had been having adventures of
their own. For three days, they had wandered through a deserted part of the
Winkie Country, subsisting largely on berries, sleeping under trees, and
looking in vain for a road to lead them back to the Emerald City. On the
second day, they had encountered an ancient woodsman, too old and deaf to
give them any information. He did, however, invite them into his hut and
give them a good dinner and a dozen sandwiches to carry away with them.
</p><p>
"But, oh, for a good old pasty!" sighed Sir Hokus late on the third
afternoon as they finished the last of the crumbly sandwiches.
</p><p>
"Do you know," said Dorothy, looking through the straggly fields and woods
ahead, "I believe we've been going in the wrong direction again."
</p><p>
"Again!" choked the Cowardly Lion. "You mean still. I've been in a good many
parts of Oz, but this&mdash;this is the worst."
</p><p>
"Not even one little dragon!" Sir Hokus shook his head mournfully. Then,
seeing that Dorothy was tired and discouraged, he pretended to strum on a
guitar and sang in his high-pitched voice:
</p><p class="poetry">
    A rusty Knight in steel bedite<br>
    And Lady Dot, so fair,<br>
    Sir Lion bold, with mane of gold<br>
    And might besides to spa&mdash;ha&mdash;hare!<br>
    And might beside to spare!<br>
    The dauntless three, a company<br>
    Of wit and bravery are,<br>
    Who seek the valiant Scarecrow man,<br>
    Who seek him near and fa&mdash;har&mdash;har,<br>
    Who seek him near and fa&mdash;har!
</p><p>
"Oh, I like that!" cried Dorothy, jumping up and giving Sir Hokus a little
squeeze. "Only you should have said trusty Knight."
</p><p>
The Cowardly Lion shook his golden mane. "Let's do a little reconnoitering,
Hokus," he said carelessly. He felt he must live up to the song somehow.
"Perhaps we'll find a sign."
</p><p>
"I don't believe in signs anymore," laughed Dorothy, "but I'm coming too."
Sir Hokus' song had cheered them all, and it wasn't the first time the
Knight had helped make the best of a tiresome journey.
</p><p>
"The air seemeth to grow very hot," observed Sir Hokus after they had walked
along silently for a time. "Hast noticed it, Sir Cowardly?"
</p><p>
"No, but I've swallowed some of it," coughed the Cowardly Lion, looking
suspiciously through the trees.
</p><p>
"I'll just step forward and see what it is," said the Knight. As he
disappeared, the truth dawned on Dorothy.
</p><p>
"Wait! Wait! Don't go! Please, please, Sir Hokus, come back, come back!"
cried the little girl, running after him as fast as she could.
</p><p>
"What's the matter?" rumbled the Cowardly Lion, thudding behind her. Then
both, coming suddenly out of the woods, gave a terrible scream, which so
startled Sir Hokus that he fell over backwards. Just in time, too, for
another step would have taken him straight on to the Deadly Desert, which
destroys every living thing and keeps all intruders away from Oz.
</p><p>
"What befell?" puffed Sir Hokus, getting to his feet. Naturally, he knew
nothing of the poisonous sands.
</p><p>
"You did," wheezed the Cowardly Lion in an agitated voice.
</p><p>
"Was it a dragon?" asked the Knight, limping toward them hopefully.
</p><p>
"Sit down!" The Cowardly Lion mopped his brow with his tail. "One step on
that desert and it would have been one long goodnight."
</p><p>
"I should say it would!" shuddered Dorothy, and explained to Sir Hokus the
deadly nature of the sands. "And do you know what this means?" Dorothy was
nearer to tears than even I like to think about. "It means we've come in
exactly the wrong direction and are farther away from the Emerald City than
we were when we started."
</p><p>
"And seek him near and fa&mdash;hah&mdash;har," mumbled Sir Hokus with a very
troubled light in his kindly blue eyes.
</p><p>
"And seek him near and far."
</p><p>
"Fah&mdash;har&mdash;har! I should say it was," said the Cowardly Lion bitterly. "But
you needn't sing it."
</p><p>
"No, I s'pose not. Uds helmets and hauberks! I s'pose not!" The Knight lapsed
into a discouraged silence, and all three sat and stared drearily at the
stretch of desert before them and thought gloomily of the rough country behind.
</p><p>
"It's a caravan," wheezed a hoarse voice.
</p><p>
"I doubt that, Camy, I doubt it very much." The shrill nasal voices so
startled the three travelers that they swung about in astonishment.
</p><p>
"Great dates and deserts!" burst out the Cowardly Lion, jumping up. And on
the whole, this exclamation was entirely suitable, for ambling toward them
were a long-legged camel and a wobbly-necked dromedary.
</p><p>
"At last! A steed!" cried the Knight, bounding to his feet.
</p><p>
"I doubt that." The dromedary stopped and looked at him coldly.
</p><p>
"Try me," said the camel amiably. "I'm more comfortable."
</p><p>
"I doubt that, too."
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/218.jpg" alt="The Doubtful Dromedary"></p>
<p class="poetry">
    "The doubtful dromedary wept,<br>
    As o'er the desert sands he stept,<br>
    Association with the sphinx<br>
    Has made him doubtful, so he thinks!"</p>
<p>
chortled the Knight with his head on one side.
</p><p>
"How did you know?" asked the Dromedary, opening his eyes wide.
</p><p>
"It just occurred to me," admitted Sir Hokus, clearing his throat modestly.
</p><p>
"I doubt that. Somebody told you," said the Doubtful Dromedary bitterly.
</p><p>
"Pon my honor," said Sir Hokus.
</p><p>
"I doubt it, I doubt it very much," persisted the Dromedary, wagging his
head sorrowfully.
</p><p>
"You seem to doubt everything!" Dorothy laughed in spite of herself, and the
Dromedary regarded her sulkily.
</p><p>
"He does," said the Camel. "It makes him very doubtful company. Now, I like
to be comfortable and happy, and you can't be if you're always doubting
things and people and places. Eh, my dear?"
</p><p>
"Where did you comfortable and doubtful parties come from?" asked the
Cowardly Lion. "Strangers here?"
</p><p>
"Well, yes," admitted the Camel, nibbling the branch of a tree. "There was a
terrific sandstorm, and after blowing and blowing and blowing, we found
ourselves in this little wood. The odd part of it is that you talk in our
language. Never knew a two-leg to understand a word of Camelia before."
</p><p>
"You're not talking Camelia, you're talking Ozish," laughed Dorothy. "All
animals can talk here."
</p><p>
"Well, now, that's very comfortable, I must say," sighed the Camel, "and if
you'd just tell me where to go, it would be more comfortable still."
</p><p>
"I doubt that," snapped the Dromedary. "They're no caravan."
</p><p>
"Where do you want to go?" asked the Cowardly Lion, ignoring the Doubtful
Dromedary.
</p><p>
"Anywhere, just so we keep moving. We're used to being told when to start
and stop, and life is mighty lonely without our Karwan Bashi," sighed the
Comfortable Camel.
</p><p>
"Why, I didn't know you smoked!" exclaimed Dorothy in surprise. She thought
the camel was referring to a brand of tobacco.
</p><p>
"He means his camel driver," whispered Sir Hokus, eyeing the soft, pillowed
seat on the camel's back longingly. Besides the seat, great sacks and bales
of goods hung from its sides. The Doubtful Dromedary was similarly loaded.
</p><p>
"Goodness!" exclaimed Dorothy. A sudden idea had struck her. "You haven't
anything to eat in those sacks, have you?"
</p><p>
"Plenty, my child&mdash;plenty!" answered the Camel calmly.
</p><p>
"Three cheers for the Comfortable Camel!" roared the Cowardly Lion, while
Sir Hokus, following the camel's directions, carefully unfastened a large,
woven basket from one of the sacks on its side.
</p><p>
"You may be my Karwan Bashi," announced the Comfortable Camel judiciously as
Sir Hokus paused for breath.
</p><p>
"Hear that, Lady Dot?" Sir Hokus swept the camel a bow and fairly beamed with
pleasure. Dorothy, meanwhile, had set out an appetizing repast on a small,
rocky ledge&mdash;a regular feast, it appeared to the hungry travelers. There
were loaves of black bread, figs, dates, cheese, and a curious sort of dried
meat which the Cowardly Lion swallowed in great quantities.
</p><p>
"Isn't this cozy?" said Dorothy, forgetting the long, weary way ahead. "My,
I'm glad we met you!"
</p><p>
"Very comforting to us, too, my dear," said the Camel, swaying complacently.
"Isn't it, Doubty?"
</p><p align="center"><img src="images/217.jpg" alt="The Comfortable Camel and the Doubtful Dromedary">
</p><p>
"There are some silk cushions in my right-hand saddle sack, but I doubt very
much whether you'll like 'em," mumbled the Dromedary gruffly.
</p><p>
"Out with them!" cried Sir Hokus, pouncing on the Doubtful Dromedary, and in
a minute each of the party had a cushion and was as snug as possible.
</p><p>
"Could anything have been more fortunate?" exulted the Knight. "We can now
resume our journey properly mounted."
</p><p>
"I think I'll ride the Cowardly Lion," said Dorothy, looking uneasily at the
high seat on the camel's back. "Let's start before it grows any darker."
</p><p>
They had eaten to heart's content, and now, packing up the remainder of the
feast, the little party made ready to start.
</p><p>
Sir Hokus, using the Cowardly Lion as a footstool, mounted the camel, and then
Dorothy climbed on her old friend's back, and the little caravan moved slowly
through the forest.
</p><p>
"There's a tent in my left-hand saddle sack, but I doubt very much whether
you can put it up," said the Doubtful Dromedary, falling in behind the
Comfortable Camel. "I doubt it very much indeed."
</p><p>
"How now, what means this doubting?" called Sir Hokus from his perilous
seat. "I'll pitch it when the time comes."
</p><p>
"Mind you don't pitch out when the Camel goes!" called the Cowardly Lion, who
would have his little joke. Sir Hokus, to tell the truth, was feeling tossed
about and dizzy, but he was too polite to mention the fact. As they proceeded,
Dorothy told the Comfortable Camel all about the Scarecrow and Oz.
</p><p>
An occasional word jolted down from above told her that the Knight was
singing. They had gone possibly a mile when Dorothy pointed in excitement
to a road just ahead.
</p><p>
"We must have missed it before! Wait, I'll see what it's like." Jumping down
from the Cowardly Lion's back, she peered curiously at the narrow,
tree-lined path. "Why, here's a sign!"
</p><p>
"What of?" asked the Comfortable Camel, lurching forward eagerly and nearly
unseating the Knight.
</p>
<p class="poetry">W I S H &nbsp; W A Y</p>
<p>
read Dorothy in a puzzled voice.
</p><p>
"Looks like a pretty good road," said the Comfortable Camel, squinting up
its eyes.
</p><p>
"I doubt it, Camy, I doubt it very much," said the Doubtful Dromedary
tremulously.
</p><p>
"What does my dear Karwan Bashi think?" asked the Comfortable Camel, looking
adoringly back at the Knight.
</p><p>
"It is unwise to go back when the journey lieth forward," said the Knight,
and immediately returned to his song. So, single file, the little company
turned in at the narrow path, the Comfortable Camel advancing with timid
steps and the Doubtful Dromedary bobbing his head dubiously.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="images/225.jpg" alt="Vanished!"></p>



<h2><a name="17">CHAPTER 17</a></h2>
<h3>DOUBTY AND CAMY VANISH INTO SPACE</h3>

<p>
For a short time, everything went well. Then Dorothy, turning to see how Sir
Hokus was getting along, discovered that the Doubtful Dromedary had
disappeared.
</p><p>
"Why, where in the world?" exclaimed Dorothy. The Comfortable Camel craned
his wobbly neck and, when he saw that his friend was gone, burst into
tears. His sobs heaved Sir Hokus clear out of his seat and flung him,
helmet first, into the dust.
</p><p>
"Go to!" exploded the Knight, sitting up. "If I were a bird, riding in yon
nest would be easier." The last of his sentence ended in a hoarse croak. Sir
Hokus vanished, and a great raven flopped down in the center of the road.
</p><p>
"Oh, where is my dear Karwan Bashi? Oh, where is Doubty?" screamed the
Comfortable Camel, running around in frenzied circles. "I wish I'd never
come on this path!"
</p><p>
"Magic!" gasped Dorothy, clutching the Cowardly Lion's mane. The Comfortable
Camel had melted into air before their very eyes.
</p><p>
"I doubt it, I doubt it very much!" coughed a faint voice close to her ear.
Dorothy ducked her head involuntarily as a big yellow butterfly settled on
the Cowardly Lion's ear.
</p><p>
"Our doubtful friend," whispered the lion weakly. "Oh, be careful, Dorothy
dear. We may turn into frogs or something worse any minute."
</p><p>
Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion had had experiences with magic transformations,
and the little girl, pressing her fingers to her eyes, tried to think of
something to do. The raven was making awkward attempts to fly and cawing "Go
to, now!" every other second.
</p><p>
"Oh, I wish dear Sir Hokus were himself again," wailed Dorothy after trying
in vain to recall some magic sentences. Presto! The Knight stood before
them, a bit breathless from flying, but hearty as ever.
</p><p>
"I see! I see!" said the Cowardly Lion with a little prance. "Every wish you
make on this road comes true. Remember the sign: 'Wish Way.' I wish the
Comfortable Camel were back. I wish the Doubtful Dromedary were himself
again," muttered the Cowardly Lion rapidly, and in an instant the two
creatures were standing in the path.
</p><p>
"Uds bodikins! So I did wish myself a bird!" gasped the Knight, rubbing his
gauntlets together excitedly.
</p><p>
"There you are! There you are!" cried the Comfortable Camel, stumbling
toward him and resting his foolish head on his shoulder. "Dear, dear Karwan
Bashi! And Doubty, old fellow, there you are too! Ah, how comfortable this
all is."
</p><p>
"Not two&mdash;one," wheezed the Doubtful Dromedary. "And Camy, I doubt very
much whether I'd care for butterflying. I just happened to wish myself
one!"
</p><p>
"Don't make any more wishes," said the Cowardly Lion sternly.
</p><p>
"Methinks a proper wish might serve us well," observed Sir Hokus. He had
been pacing up and down in great excitement. "Why not wish&mdash;"
</p><p>
"Oh, stop!" begged Dorothy. "Wait till we've thought it all out. Wishing's
awfully particular work!"
</p><p>
"One person better speak for the party," said the Cowardly Lion. "Now, I
suggest&mdash;"
</p><p>
"Oh, be careful!" screamed Dorothy again. "I wish you would all stop
wishing!" Sir Hokus looked at her reproachfully. No wonder. At Dorothy's
words, they all found themselves unable to speak. The Doubtful Dromedary's
eyes grew rounder and rounder. For the first time in its life, it was
unable to doubt anything.
</p><p>
"Now I'll have to do it all," thought Dorothy, and closing her eyes she tried
to think of the very best wish for everybody concerned. It was night and
growing darker. The Cowardly Lion, the Camel and Dromedary and Sir Hokus
peered anxiously at the little girl, wondering what in the world was going to
happen. Being wished around is no joke. For five minutes Dorothy thought and
thought. Then, standing in the middle of the road, she made her wish in a
clear, distinct voice. It was not a very long wish. To be exact, it had only
eight words. Eight&mdash;short&mdash;little words! But stars! No sooner were they
out of Dorothy's mouth than the earth opened with a splintering crash and
swallowed up the whole company!
</p>

<h2><a name="18">CHAPTER 18</a></h2>
<h3>DOROTHY FINDS THE SCARECROW!</h3>

<p>
The next thing Dorothy knew, she was sitting on the hard floor of a  great,
dark hall. One lantern burned feebly, and in the dim, silvery light she
could just make out the Comfortable Camel scrambling awkwardly to his feet.
</p><p>
"I smell straw," sniffed the Camel softly.
</p><p>
"I doubt very much whether I am going to like this place." The voice of the
Doubtful Dromedary came hesitatingly through the gloom.
</p><p>
"By sword and scepter!" gasped the Knight, "Are you there, Sir Cowardly?"
</p><p>
"Thank goodness, they are!" said Dorothy. Wishing other people about is a
risky and responsible business. "They're all here, but I wonder where here
is." She jumped up, but at a shuffle of feet drew back.
</p><p>
"Pigs! Weasels!" shrilled an angry voice, and a fat little man hurled
himself at Sir Hokus, who happened to have fallen in the lead.
</p><p>
"Uds trudgeons and bludgeons and maugre thy head!" roared the Knight,
shaking him off like a fly.
</p><p>
"Tappy, Tappy, my dear boy. Caution! What's all this?" At the sound of that
dear, familiar voice Dorothy's heart gave a skip of joy, and without
stopping to explain she rushed forward.
</p><p>
"Dorothy!" cried the Scarecrow, stepping on his kimona and falling off his
silvery throne. "Lights, Tappy! More lights, at once!" But Tappy was too busy
backing away from Sir Hokus of Pokes.
</p><p>
"Approach, vassal!" thundered the Knight, who under-stood not a word of
Tappy's speech. "Approach! I think I've been insulted!" He drew his sword
and glared angrily through the darkness, and Tappy, having backed as far as
possible, fell heels over pigtail into the silver fountain. At the loud
splash, Dorothy hastened to the rescue.
</p><p>
"They're friends, and we've found the Scarecrow, we've found the Scarecrow!"
She seized Sir Hokus and shook him till his armor rattled.
</p><p>
"Tappy! Tappy!" called the Scarecrow. "Where in the world did he pagota?"
That's exactly what he said, but to Dorothy it sounded like no language at all.
</p><p>
"Why," she cried in dismay, "it's the Scarecrow, but I can't understand a
word he's saying!"
</p><p>
"I think he must be talking Turkey," droned the Comfortable Camel, "or
donkey! I knew a donkey once, a very uncomfortable party, I&mdash;"
</p><p>
"I doubt it's donkey," put in the Dromedary importantly, but no one paid any
attention to the two beasts. For Happy Toko had at last dragged himself out
of the fountain and set fifteen lanterns glowing.
</p><p>
"Oh!" gasped Dorothy as the magnificent silver throne room was flooded with
light, "Where are we?"
</p><p>
The Scarecrow had picked himself up, and with outstretched arms came running
toward her talking a perfect Niagara of Silver Islandish.
</p><p>
"Have you forgotten your Ozish so soon?" rumbled the Cowardly Lion
reproachfully as Dorothy flung her arms around the Scarecrow. The
Scarecrow, seeing the Cowardly Lion for the first time, fairly fell upon
his neck. Then he brushed his clumsy hand across his forehead.
</p><p>
"Wasn't I talking Ozish?" he asked in a puzzled voice.
</p><p>
"Oh, now you are!" exclaimed Dorothy. And sure enough, the Scarecrow was
talking plain Ozish again. (Which I don't mind telling you is also plain
English.)
</p><p>
The Knight had been watching this little reunion with hardly repressed
emotion. Advancing hastily, he dropped on one knee.
</p><p>
"My good sword and lance are ever at thy service, my Lord Scarecrow!" he
exclaimed feelingly.
</p><p>
"Who is this impulsive person?" gulped the Scarecrow, staring in undisguised
astonishment at the kneeling figure of the Sir Hokus of Pokes.
</p><p>
"He's my Knight Errant, and he's taken such good care of me," explained
Dorothy eagerly.
</p><p>
"Splendid fellow," hissed the Cowardly Lion in the Scarecrow's other painted
ear, "if he does talk odds and ends."
</p><p>
"Any friend of little Dorothy's is my friend," said the Scarecrow, shaking
hands with Sir Hokus warmly. "But what I want to know is how you all got here."
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/235.jpg" alt="Dorothy and the Scarecrow"></p>
<p>
"First tell us where we are," begged the little girl, for the Scarecrow's
silver hat and queue filled her with alarm.
</p><p>
"You are on the Silver Island," said the Scarecrow slowly. "And I am the
Emperor&mdash;or his good-for-nothing spirit&mdash;and tomorrow," the Scarecrow
glared around wildly, "tomorrow I'll be eighty-five going on eighty-six."
His voice broke and ended in a barely controlled sob.
</p><p>
"Doubt that," drawled the Doubtful Dromedary sleepily.
</p><p>
"Eighty-five years old!" gasped Dorothy. "Why, no one in Oz grows any older!"
</p><p>
"We are no longer in Oz." The Scarecrow shook his head sadly. Then, fixing
the group with a puzzled stare, he exclaimed, "But how did you get here?"
</p><p>
"On a <i>wish</i>," said the Knight in a hollow voice.
</p><p>
"Yes," said Dorothy, "we've been hunting you all over Oz, and at last we
came to Wish Way, and I said 'I wish we were all with the Scarecrow,' just
like that&mdash;and next minute&mdash;"
</p><p>
"We fell and fell&mdash;and fell&mdash;and fell," wheezed the Comfortable Camel.
</p><p>
"And fell&mdash;and fell&mdash;and fell&mdash;and fell," droned the Dromedary, "And&mdash;"
</p><p>
"Here you are," finished the Scarecrow hastily, for the Dromedary showed
signs of going on forever.
</p><p>
"Now tell us every single thing that has happened to you," demanded Dorothy
eagerly.
</p><p>
Happy Toko had recognized Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion from the Scarecrow's
description, and he now approached with an arm full of cushions. These he
set in a circle on the floor, with one for the Scarecrow in the center, and
with a warning finger on his lips placed himself behind his Master.
</p><p>
"Tappy is right!" exclaimed the Scarecrow. "We must be as quiet as possible,
for a great danger hangs over me."
</p><p>
Without more ado, he told them of his amazing fall down the beanstalk; of
his adventures on Silver Island; of his sons and grandsons and the
Gheewizard's elixir which would turn him from a lively Scarecrow into an
old, old Emperor. All that I have told you, he told Dorothy, up to the very
point where his eldest son had bound him to the bean pole and tied up poor,
faithful Happy Toko. Happy, it seems, had at last managed to free himself,
and they were about to make their escape when Dorothy and her party had
fallen into the throne room. The Comfortable Camel and Doubtful Dromedary
lis-tened politely at first, but worn out by their exciting adventures,
fell asleep in the middle of the story.
</p><p>
Nothing could have exceeded Dorothy's dismay to learn that the jolly Scarecrow
of Oz, whom she had discovered herself, was in reality Chang Wang Woe, Emperor
of Silver Island.
</p><p>
"Oh, this spoils everything!" wailed the little girl. (The thought of Oz
without the Scarecrow was unthinkable.) "It spoils everything! We were
going to adopt you and be your truly family. Weren't we?"
</p><p>
The Cowardly Lion nodded. "I was going to be your cousin," he mumbled in a
choked voice, "but now that you have a family of your own&mdash;" The
lion miserably slunk down beside Dorothy.
</p><p>
Sir Hokus looked fierce and rattled his sword, but he could think of nothing
that would help them out of their trouble.
</p><p>
"To-morrow there won't be any Scarecrow in Oz!" wailed Dorothy. "Oh, dear!
Oh, dear!" And the little girl began to cry as if her heart would break.
</p><p>
"Stop! Stop!" begged the Scarecrow, while Sir Hokus awkwardly patted Dorothy
on the back. "I'd rather have you for my family any day. I don't care a
Kinkajou for being Emperor, and as for my sons, they are unnatural villains
who make my life miserable by telling me how old I am!"
</p><p>
"Just like a poem I once read," said Dorothy, brightening up:
</p><p class="poetry">
    "You are old, Father William," the young man said,<br>
    "And your hair has become very white,<br>
    And yet you incessantly stand on your head!<br>
    Do you think, at your age, it is right?"
</p><p>
"That's it, that's it exactly!" exclaimed the Scarecrow as Dorothy finished
repeating the verse. "'You are old, Father Scarecrow!' That's all I hear.
I did stand on my head, too. And Dorothy, I can't seem to get used to being
a grandparent," added the Scarecrow in a melancholy voice. "It's turning my
straws gray." He plucked several from his chest and held them out to her.
"Why, those little villains don't even believe in Oz! 'It's not on the map,
old Grandpapapapapah!' " he mumbled, imitating the tones of his little
grandsons so cleverly that Dorothy laughed in spite of herself.
</p><p>
"This is what becomes of pride!" The Scarecrow extended his hands
expressively. "Most people who hunt up their family trees are in for a fall,
and I've had mine."
</p><p>
"But who do you want to be?" asked the Knight gravely. "A Scarecrow in Oz&mdash;
or the&mdash;er&mdash;Emperor that you were?"
</p><p>
"I don't care who I were!" In his excitement, the Scarecrow lost his grammar
completely. "I want to be who I am. I want to be myself."
</p><p>
"But which one?" asked the Cowardly Lion, who was still a bit confused.
</p><p>
"Why, my best self, of course," said the Scarecrow with a bright smile. The
sight of his old friends had quite restored his cheerfulness. "I've been
here long enough to know that I am a better Scarecrow than an Emperor."
</p><p>
"Why, how simple it is!" sighed Dorothy contentedly. "Professor Wogglebug
was all wrong. It's not what you were, but what you are&mdash;it's being
yourself that counts."
</p><p>
"By my Halidom, the little maid is right!" said Sir Hokus, slapping his knee
in delight. "Let your Gheewizard but try his transformations! Out on him!
But what says yon honest henchman?" Happy Toko, although he understood no
word of the conversation, had been watching the discussion with great
interest. He had been trying to attract the Scarecrow's attention for some
time, but the Knight was the only one who had noticed him.
</p><p>
"What is it, Tappy?" asked the Scarecrow, dropping easily back into Silver
Islandish.
</p><p>
"Honored Master, the dawn approaches and with it the Royal Princes and the
Grand Gheewizard&mdash;and your bride!" Happy paused significantly. The
Scarecrow shuddered.
</p><p>
"Let's go back to Oz!" said the Cowardly Lion uneasily.
</p><p>
The Scarecrow was feeling in the pocket of his old Munchkin suit which he
always wore under his robes of state. "Here!" said he, giving a little pill
to Happy Toko. "It's one of Professor Wogglebug's language pills," he
exclaimed to Dorothy, "and will enable him to speak and understand Ozish."
Happy swallowed the pill gravely.
</p><p>
"Greetings, honorable Ozites!" he said politely as soon as the pill was
down. Dorothy clapped her hands in delight, for it was so comfortable to
have him speak their own language.
</p><p>
"I could never have stood it here without Tappy Oko!" The Scarecrow looked
fondly at his Imperial Punster.
</p><p>
"Queer name he has," rumbled the Cowardly Lion, looking at Happy Toko as if
he had thoughts of eating him.
</p><p>
"Methinks he should be knighted," rumbled Sir Hokus, beaming on the little
Silverman. "Rise, Sir Pudding!"
</p><p>
"The sun will do that in a minute or more, and then, then we shall all be
thrown into prison!" wailed Happy Toko dismally.
</p><p>
"We were going to escape in a small boat," explained the Scarecrow, "but&mdash;"
It was not necessary for him to finish. A boat large enough to hold Dorothy,
the Cowardly Lion, the Scarecrow, Happy Toko, the camel and the dromedary
could not very well be launched in secret.
</p><p>
"Oh, dear!" sighed Dorothy, "If I'd only wished you and all of us back in
the Emerald City!"
</p><p>
"You wished very well, Lady Dot," said the Knight. "When I think of what I
was going to wish for&mdash;"
</p><p>
"What were you going to wish, Hokus?" asked the Cowardly Lion curiously.
</p><p>
"For a dragon!" faltered the Knight, looking terribly ashamed.
</p><p>
"A dragon!" gasped Dorothy. "Why, what good would that have done us?"
</p><p>
"Wait!" interrupted the Scarecrow. "I have thought of something! Why not
climb my family tree? It is a long, long way, but at the top lies Oz!"
</p><p>
"Grammercy, a pretty plan!" exclaimed Sir Hokus, peering up at the bean pole.
</p><p>
"Wouldn't that be social climbing?" chuckled Happy Toko, recovering his
spirits with a bound. The Cowardly Lion said nothing, but heaved a mighty
sigh which no one heard, for they were all running toward the bean pole. It
was a good family tree to climb, sure enough, for there were handy little
notches in the stalk.
</p><p>
"You go first!" Sir Hokus helped Dorothy up. When she had gone a few steps,
the Scarecrow, holding his robes carefully, followed, then honest Happy Toko.
</p><p>
"I'll go last," said Sir Hokus bravely, and had just set his foot on the
first notch when a hoarse scream rang through the hall.
</p>

<h2><a name="19">CHAPTER 19</a></h2>
<h3>PLANNING TO FLY FROM THE SILVER ISLAND</h3>
<p>
It was the Comfortable Camel. Waking suddenly, he found himself deserted. "Oh,
where is my dear Karwan Bashi?" he roared dismally. "Come back! Come back!"
</p><p>
"Hush up, can't you?" rumbled the Cowardly Lion. "Do you want Dorothy and
everybody to be thrown into prison on our account? We can't climb the bean
pole and will have to wait here and face it out."
</p><p>
"But how uncomfortable," wailed the camel. He began to sob heavily. Dorothy,
although highest up the bean pole, heard all of this distinctly. "Oh," she
cried remorsefully, "we can't desert the Cowardly Lion like this. I never
thought about him."
</p><p>
"Spoken like the dear little Maid you are," said the Knight. "The good beast
never reminded us of it, either. There's bravery for you!"
</p><p>
"Let us descend at once, I'll not move a step without the Cowardly Lion!" In
his agitation, the Scarecrow lost his balance and fell headlong to the ground,
knocking Sir Hokus's helmet terribly askew as he passed. The others made haste
to follow him and were soon gathered gravely at the foot of the beanstalk.
</p><p>
"I'll have to think of some other plan," said the Scarecrow, looking
nervously at the sky, which showed, through the long windows, the first
streaks of dawn. The Comfortable Camel controlled its sobs with difficulty
and pressed as close to Sir Hokus as it could. The Doubtful Dromedary was
still asleep.
</p><p>
"It would have been a terrible climb," mused the Scarecrow, thinking of his
long, long fall down the pole. "Ah, I have it!"
</p><p>
"What?" asked Dorothy anxiously.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/247.jpg" alt="The Doubtful Dromedary"></p>
<p>
"I wonder I did not think of it before. Ah, my brains are working better! I
will abdicate," exclaimed the Scarecrow triumphantly. "I will abdicate,
make a farewell speech, and return with you to Oz!"
</p><p>
"What if they refuse to let your radiant Highness go?" put in Happy Toko
tremulously. "What if the Gheewizard should work his magic before you
finished your speech?"
</p><p>
"Then we'll make a dash for it!" said Sir Hokus, twirling his sword recklessly.
</p><p>
"I'm with you," said the Cowardly Lion huskily, "but you needn't have come
back for me."
</p><p>
"All right!" said the Scarecrow cheerfully. "And now that everything's
settled so nicely, we might as well enjoy the little time left. Put out the
lights, Tappy. Dorothy and I will sit on the throne, and the rest of you
come as close as possible."
</p><p>
Sir Hokus wakened the Doubtful Dromedary and pulled and tugged it across the
hall, where it immediately fell down asleep again. The Comfortable Camel
ambled about eating the flowers out of the vases. The Cowardly Lion had placed
himself at Dorothy's feet, and Sir Hokus and Happy Toko seated themselves upon
the first step of the gorgeous silver throne.
</p><p>
Then, while they waited for morning, Dorothy told the Scarecrow all about the
Pokes and Fix City, and the Scarecrow told once again of his victory over the
king of the Golden Islands.
</p><p>
"Where is the magic fan now?" asked Dorothy at the end of the story.
</p><p>
The Scarecrow smiled broadly, and feeling in a deep pocket brought out the
little fan and also the parasol he had plucked from the beanstalk. "Do you
know," he said smiling, "so much has happened I haven't thought of them
since the battle. I was saving them for you, Dorothy."
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/249.jpg" alt="The Doubtful Dromedary"></p>
<p>
"For me!" exclaimed the little girl in delight. "Let me see them!" The
Scarecrow handed them over obligingly, but Happy Toko trembled so violently
that he rolled down the steps of the throne.
</p><p>
"I beg of you!" He scrambled to his feet and held up his hands in terror. "I
beg of you, don't open that fan!"
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/250.jpg" alt="&quot;Don't open that fan!&quot;"></p>
<p>
"She's used to magic, Tappy. You needn't worry," said the Scarecrow easily.
</p><p>
"Of course I am," said Dorothy with great dignity. "But this'll be mighty
useful if anyone tries to conquer Oz again. We can just fan 'em away."
</p><p align="center"><img src="images/250b.jpg" alt="Dorothy asserts she's used to magic">
</p><p>
Dorothy pulled a hair from the Cowardly Lion's mane, and winding it around
the little fan, put it carefully in the pocket of her dress. The parasol
she hung by its ribbon to her arm.
</p><p>
"Perhaps Ozma will look in the Magic Picture and wish us all back again," said
the little girl after they had sat for a time in silence.
</p><p>
"I doubt it." The Dromedary stirred and mumbled in its sleep.
</p><p>
"Singular beast, that!" ejaculated the Knight. "Doubting never gets one
anywhere."
</p><p>
"Hush!" warned the Scarecrow. "I hear footsteps!"
</p><p>
"Come here." Sir Hokus called hoarsely to the camel, who was eating a paper
lantern at the other end of the room. The beast ran awkwardly over to the
throne, and swallowing the lantern with a convulsive gulp, settled down
beside the dromedary.
</p><p>
"Whatever happens, we must stick together," said the Knight emphatically.
"Ah&mdash;!"
</p><p>
Dorothy held fast to the Scarecrow with one hand and to the throne with the
other. The sun had risen at last. There was a loud crash of drums and
trumpets, a rush of feet, and into the hall marched the most splendid
company Dorothy had seen in her whole life of adventures.
</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="images/253.jpg" alt="A parade"></p>
<h2><a name="20">CHAPTER 20</a></h2>
<h3>DOROTHY UPSETS THE CEREMONY OF THE ISLAND</h3>

<p>
"A caravan!" whistled the Comfortable Camel, lurching to his feet. "How nice!"
</p><p>
"I doubt that!" The dromedary's eyes flew open, and he stared sleepily at
the magnificent procession of Silver Islanders.
</p><p>
First came the musicians, playing their shining silver trumpets and flutes.
The Grand Chew Chew and General Mugwump followed, attired in brilliant silk
robes of state. Then came the three Princes, glittering with jeweled chains
and medals, and the fifteen little Princes, like so many silver butterflies in
their satin kimonas. Next appeared a palanquin bearing the veiled Princess
Orange Blossom, followed by a whole company of splendid courtiers and after
them as many of the everyday Silver Islanders as the hall would hold. There
was a moment of silence. Then the whole assemblage, contrary to the
Scarecrow's edict, fell upon their faces.
</p><p>
"My!" exclaimed Dorothy, impressed in spite of herself. "Are you sure you
want to give up all this?"
</p><p>
"Great Emperor, beautiful as the sun, wise as the stars, and radiant as the
clouds, the Ceremony of Restoration is about to begin!" quavered the Grand
Chew Chew, rising slowly. Then he paused, for he was suddenly confused by
the strange company around the Scarecrow's throne.
</p><p>
"Treachery!" hissed the eldest Prince to the others. "We left him tied to
the bean pole. Ancient Papa Scarecrow needs watching! Who are these curious
objects he has gathered about him, pray?"
</p><p>
Now by some magic which even I cannot explain, the people from Oz found they
could understand all that was being said. When Dorothy heard herself called
an object and saw the wicked faces of the three Princes and the stupid
little grandsons, she no longer wondered at the Scarecrow's decision.
</p><p>
The Scarecrow himself bowed calmly. "First," said he cheerfully, "let me
introduce my friends and visitors from Oz."
</p><p>
The Silver Islanders, who really loved the Scarecrow, bowed politely as he
called out the names of Dorothy and the others. But the three Silver Princes
scowled and whispered indignantly among themselves.
</p><p>
"I am growing very wroth!" choked Sir Hokus to the Cowardly Lion.
</p><p>
"Let the ceremony proceed!" called the eldest Prince harshly, before the
Scarecrow had finished his introductions. "Let the proper body of his
Serene Highness be immediately restored. Way for the Grand Gheewizard! Way
for the Grand Gheewizard!"
</p><p>
"One moment," put in the Scarecrow in a dignified voice. "I have something
to say." The Silver Islanders clapped loudly at this, and Dorothy felt a
bit reassured. Perhaps they would listen to reason after all and let the
Scarecrow depart peacefully. How they were ever to escape if they didn't,
the little girl could not see.
</p><p>
"My dear children," began the Scarecrow in his jolly voice, "nothing could
have been more wonderful than my return to this lovely island, but in the
years I have been away from you I have changed very much, and I find I no
longer care for being Emperor. So with your kind permission, I will keep
the excellent body I now have and will abdicate in favor of my eldest son
and return with my friends to Oz. For in Oz I really belong."
</p><p>
A dead silence followed the Scarecrow's speech&mdash;then perfect pandemonium.
</p><p>
"No! No! You are a good Emperor! We will not let you go!" shrieked the
people. "You are our honorable little Father. The Prince shall be Emperor
after you have peacefully returned to your ancestors, but not now. No! No!
We will not have it!"
</p><p>
"I feared this!" quavered Happy Toko.
</p><p>
"It is not the Emperor, but the Scarecrow who speaks!" shrilled the Grand
Chew Chew craftily. "He knows not what he says. But after the
transformation&mdash;Ah, you shall see!"
</p><p>
The company calmed down at this. "Let the ceremony proceed! Way for the
Grand Gheewizard!" they cried exultantly.
</p><p>
"Chew Chew," wailed the Scarecrow, "you're off the track!" But it was too
late. No one would listen.
</p><p>
"I'll have to think of something else," muttered the Scarecrow, sinking
dejectedly back on his throne.
</p><p>
"Oh!" shuddered Dorothy, clutching the Scarecrow, "Here he comes!"
</p><p>
"Way for the Grand Gheewizard! Way for the Grand Gheewizard!"
</p><p>
The crowd parted. Hobbling toward the throne came the ugly little Gheewizard
of the Silver Island holding a large silver vase high above his head, and
after him&mdash;!
</p><p>
When Sir Hokus caught a glimpse of what came after, he leaped clean over the
Comfortable Camel.
</p><p>
"Uds daggers!" roared the Knight. "<i>At last!"</i></p>
<p>He rushed forward violently.
There was a sharp thrust of his good sword, then an explosion like twenty
giant firecrackers in one, and the room became quite black with smoke. Before
anyone realized what had happened, Sir Hokus was back, dragging something
after him and shouting exuberantly, "A dragon! I have slain a dragon! What
happiness!"
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/258.jpg" alt="Slaying the dragon"></p>
<p>
Everyone was coughing and spluttering from the smoke, but as it cleared
Dorothy saw that it was indeed a dragon Sir Hokus had slain, the rheumatic
dragon of the old Gheewizard himself.
</p><p>
"Why didn't you get the wizard?" rumbled the Cowardly Lion angrily.
</p><p>
"Must have exploded," said the Comfortable Camel, sniffing the skin daintily.
</p><p>
"Treason!" yelled the three Princes, while the Grand Gheewizard flung
himself on the stone floor and began tearing strand after strand from his
silver pigtail.
</p><p>
"He has killed the little joy of my hearth!" screeched the old man. "I will
turn him to a cat, a miserable yellow cat, and roast him for dinner!"
</p><p>
"Oh!" cried Dorothy, looking at Sir Hokus sorrowfully. "How could you?"
</p><p>
The slaying of the dragon had thrown the whole hall into utmost confusion.
Sir Hokus turned a little pale under his armor, but faced the angry mob
without flinching.
</p><p>
"Oh, my dear Karwan Bashi, this is so uncomfortable!" wheezed the camel,
glancing back of him with frightened eyes.
</p><p>
"There's a shiny dagger in my left-hand saddlesack. I doubt very much
whether they would like it," coughed the Doubtful Dromedary, pressing close
to the Knight.
</p><p>
"On with the ceremony!" cried the eldest Prince, seeing that the excitement
was giving the Scarecrow's friends too much time to think. "The son of an
iron pot shall be punished later!"
</p><p>
"That's right!" cried a voice from the crowd. "Let the Emperor be restored!"
</p><p>
"I guess it's all over," gulped the Scarecrow. "Give my love to Ozma and tell
her I tried to come back."
</p><p>
In helpless terror, the little company watched the Gheewizard approach. One
could fight real enemies, but <i>magic!</i> Even Sir Hokus, brave as he was, felt
that nothing could be done.
</p><p>
"One move and you shall be so many prunes," shrilled the angry old man,
fixing the people from Oz with his wicked little eyes. The great room was
so still you could have heard a pin drop. Even the Doubtful Dromedary had
not the heart to doubt the wizard's power, but stood rigid as a statue.
</p><p>
The wizard advanced slowly, holding the sealed vase carefully over his head.
The poor Scarecrow regarded it with gloomy fascination. One more moment and
he would be an old, old Silverman. Better to be lost forever! He held
convulsively to Dorothy.
</p><p>
As for Dorothy herself, she was trembling with fright and grief. When the
Grand Gheewizard raised the vase higher and higher and made ready to hurl it
at the Scarecrow, disregarding his dire threat she gave a shrill scream and
threw up both hands.
</p><p>
"Great grandmothers!" gasped the Scarecrow, jumping to his feet. As Dorothy
had thrown up her arms, the little parasol swinging at her wrist had jerked
open. Up, up, up, and out through the broken skylight in the roof sailed
the little Princess of Oz!
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/261.jpg" alt="Up went the little Princess of Oz"></p>
<p>
The Grand Gheewizard, startled as anyone, failed to throw the vase. Every neck
was craned upward, and everyone was gasping with astonishment.
</p><p>
The oldest Prince, as usual, was the first to recover. "Don't stand staring
like an idiot! Now's your chance!" he hissed angrily in the Gheewizard's ear.
</p><p>
"I didn't come here to be harried and hurried by foreigners," sobbed the
little man. "How is one to work magic when interrupted every other minute?
I want my little dragon."
</p><p>
"Oh, come on now, just throw it. I'll get you another dragon," begged the
Prince, his hands trembling with excitement.
</p><p>
In the face of this new disaster, the Scarecrow had forgotten all about the
Gheewizard. He and the Cowardly Lion and Sir Hokus were running distractedly
around the great throne trying to think up a way to rescue Dorothy. As for the
Doubtful Dromedary, he was doubting everything in a loud, bitter voice, while
the Comfortable Camel fairly snorted with sorrow.
</p><p>
"There! Now's your chance," whispered the Prince. The Scarecrow, with his
back to the crowd, was gesturing frantically.
</p><p>
Taking a firm hold on the neck of the vase and with a long incantation which
there is no use at all in repeating, the Gheewizard flung the bottle straight
at the Scarecrow's head. But scarcely had it left his hand before there was a
flash and a flutter and down came Dorothy and the magic parasol right on top
of the vase.
</p><p>
Zip! The vase flew in quite another direction, and next minute had burst over
the luckless heads of the three plotting Princes, while Dorothy floated gently
to earth.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/263.jpg" alt="Burst over the heasd of the three princes"></p>
<p>
Sir Hokus embraced the Scarecrow, and the Scarecrow hugged the Cowardly
Lion, and I don't wonder at all. For no sooner had the magic elixir touched
the Princes, than two of them became silver pigs and the eldest a weasel.
They had been turned to their true shapes instead of the Scarecrow. And
while the company hopped about in alarm, they ran squealing from the hall
and disappeared in the gardens.
</p><p>
"Seize the Gheewizard and take him to his cave," ordered the Scarecrow,
asserting his authority for the first time since the proceedings has
started. He had noticed the old man making queer signs and passes toward
Sir Hokus. A dozen took hold of the struggling Gheewizard and hurried him
out of the hall.
</p><p>
Sir Hokus, at the request of the Scarecrow, clapped his iron gauntlets for
silence.
</p><p>
"You will agree with me, I'm sure," said the Scarecrow in a slightly unsteady
voice, "that magic is a serious matter to meddle with. If you will all return
quietly to your homes, I will try to find a way out of our difficulties."
</p><p>
The Silver Islanders listened respectfully and after a little arguing among
themselves backed out of the throne room. To tell the truth, they were
anxious to spread abroad the tale of the morning's happenings.
</p><p>
Princess Orange Blossom, however, refused to depart. Magic or no magic, she
had come to marry the Emperor, and she would not leave till the ceremony had
been performed.
</p><p>
"But my dear old Lady, would you wish to marry a Scarecrow?" coaxed the
Emperor.
</p><p>
"All men are Scarecrows," snapped the Princess sourly.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/265.jpg" alt="Priness Orange Blossom argues"></p>
<p>
"Then why marry at all?" rumbled the Cowardly Lion, making a playful leap at
her palanquin. This was too much. The Princess swooned on the spot, and the
Scarecrow, taking advantage of her unconscious condition, ordered her chair
bearers to carry her away as far and as fast as they could run.
</p><p>
"Now," said the Scarecrow when the last of the company had disappeared, "let
us talk this over."
</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="images/267.jpg" alt="Dorothy's fan"></p>



<h2><a name="21">CHAPTER 21</a></h2>
<h3>THE ESCAPE FROM THE SILVER ISLAND</h3>
<p>
"Well!" gasped Dorothy, fanning herself with her hat, "I never was so
s'prised in my life!"
</p><p>
"Nor I," exclaimed the Scarecrow. "The Grand Gheewizard will be suing you
for parassault and battery. But how did it happen?"
</p><p>
"Well," began Dorothy, "as soon as the parasol opened, I flew up so fast
that I could hardly breathe. Then, after I'd gone ever so far, it came to
me that if the parasol went up when it was up, it would come down when it
was down. I couldn't leave you all in such a fix&mdash;so I closed it, and&mdash;"
</p><p>
"Came down!" finished the Scarecrow with a wave of his hand. "You always do
the right thing in the right place, my dear."
</p><p>
"It was lucky I hit the vase, wasn't it?" sighed Dorothy. "But I'm rather
sorry about the Princes."
</p><p>
"Served 'em right," growled the Cowardly Lion. "They'll make very good pigs!"
</p><p>
"But who's to rule the island?" demanded Sir Hokus, turning his gaze
reluctantly from the smoking dragonskin.
</p><p>
"This will require thought," said the Scarecrow pensively. "Let us all think."
</p><p>
"I doubt that I can ever think again." The Doubtful Dromedary wagged his
head from side to side in a dazed fashion.
</p><p>
"Just leave it to our dear Karwan Bashi." The Comfortable Camel nodded
complacently at the Knight and began plucking sly wisps from the
Scarecrow's boot top. For a short time there was absolute silence.
</p><p>
Then Sir Hokus, who had been thinking tremendously with his elbows on his
knees, burst out, "Why not Sir Pudding, here? Why not this honest Punster?
Who but Happy Toko deserves the throne?"
</p><p>
"The very person!" cried the Scarecrow, clasping his yellow gloves, and
taking off his silver hat, he set it impulsively upon the head of the fat
little Silver Islander.
</p><p>
"He'll make a lovely Emperor," said Dorothy. "He's so kind-hearted and
jolly. And now the Scarecrow can abdicate and come home to Oz."
</p><p>
They all looked triumphantly at the Imperial Punster, but Happy Toko,
snatching off the royal hat, burst into tears.
</p><p>
"Don't leave me behind, amiable Master!" he sobbed disconsolately. "Oh, how
I shall miss you!"
</p><p>
"But don't you see," coaxed Dorothy, "the Scarecrow needs you here more than
anyplace, and think of all the fine clothes you will have and how rich you
will be!"
</p><p>
"And Tappy, my dear boy," said the Scarecrow, putting his arm around Happy
Toko, "you might not like Oz any more than I like Silver Island. Then think
&mdash;if everything goes well, you can visit me&mdash;just as one Emperor visits
another!"
</p><p>
"And you won't forget me?" sniffed Happy, beginning to like the idea of
being Emperor.
</p><p>
"Never!" cried the Scarecrow with an impressive wave.
</p><p>
"And if anything goes wrong, will you help me out?" questioned Happy
uncertainly.
</p><p>
"We'll look in the Magic Picture of Oz every month," declared Dorothy, "and
if you need us we'll surely find some way to help you."
</p><p>
"An' you ever require a trusty sword, Odds Bodikins!" exclaimed Sir Hokus,
pressing Tappy's hand, "I'm your man!"
</p><p>
"All right, dear Master!" Happy slowly picked up the Imperial hat and set it
sideways on his head. "I'll do my best."
</p><p>
"I don't doubt it at all," said the Doubtful Dromedary to everyone's
surprise.
</p><p>
"Three cheers for the Emperor! Long live the Emperor of the Silver Island,"
rumbled the Cowardly Lion, and everybody from Oz, even the camel and
dromedary, fell upon their knees before Happy Toko.
</p><p>
"You may have my bride, too, Tappy," chuckled the Scarecrow with a wink at
Dorothy. "And Tappy," he asked, sobering suddenly, "will you have my
grandsons brought up like real children? Just as soon as I return, I shall
send them all the Books of Oz."
</p><p>
Happy bowed, too confused and excited for speech.
</p><p>
"Now," said the Scarecrow, seizing Dorothy's hand, "I can return to Oz with
an easy mind."
</p><p>
"Doubt that," said the Doubtful Dromedary.
</p><p>
"You needn't!" announced Dorothy. "I've thought it all out." In a few short
sentences she outlined her plan.
</p><p>
"Bravo!" roared the Cowardly Lion, and now the little party began in real
earnest the preparation for the journey back to Oz.
</p><p>
First, Happy brought them a delicious luncheon, with plenty of twigs and hay
for the camel and dromedary and meat for the Cowardly Lion. The Scarecrow
packed into the camel's sacks a few little souvenirs for the people of Oz.
Then they dressed Happy Toko in the Scarecrow's most splendid robe and ordered
him to sit upon the throne. Next, the Scarecrow rang for one of the palace
servants and ordered the people of the Silver Islands to assemble in the hall.
</p><p align="center"><img src="images/271.jpg" alt="Happy Toko in the Scarecrow's robe">
</p><p>
Presently the Silvermen began to come trooping in, packing the great
throne room until it could hold no more. Everyone was chattering excitedly.
</p><p>
It was quite a different company that greeted them. The Scarecrow, cheerful
and witty in his old Munchkin suit, Dorothy and Sir Hokus smiling happily,
and the three animal members of the party fairly blinking with contentment.
</p><p>
"This," said the Scarecrow pleasantly when everyone was quiet, "is your new
Emperor, to whom I ask you to pledge allegiance." He waved proudly in the
direction of Happy Toko, who, to tell the truth, presented a truly royal
appearance. "It is not possible for me to remain with you, but I shall
always watch over this delightful island and with the magic fan vanquish
all its enemies and punish all offenders."
</p><p>
Happy Toko bowed to his subjects.
</p><p>
The Silver Islanders exchanged startled glances, then, as the Scarecrow
carelessly lifted the fan, they fell prostrate to the earth.
</p><p>
"Ah!" said the Scarecrow with a broad wink at Happy. "This is delightful. You
agree with me, I see. Now then, three cheers for Tappy Oko, Imperial Emperor
of the Silver Island."
</p><p>
The cheers were given with a will, and Happy in acknowledgement made a speech
that has since been written into the Royal Book of state as a masterpiece of
eloquence.
</p><p>
Having arranged affairs so satisfactorily, the Scarecrow embraced Happy Toko
with deep emotion. Dorothy and Sir Hokus shook hands with him and wished
him every success and happiness. Then the little party from Oz walked
deliberately to the bean pole in the center of the hall.
</p><p>
The Silver Islanders were still a bit dazed by the turn affairs had taken and
stared in astonishment as the Scarecrow and Sir Hokus fastened thick ropes
around the Cowardly Lion, the Doubtful Dromedary and the Comfortable Camel.
Similar ropes they tied around their own waists and Dorothy's, and the ends
of all were fastened securely to the handle of the magic parasol, which
Dorothy held carefully.
</p><p>
"Goodbye, everybody!" called the little girl, suddenly opening the parasol.
</p><p>
"Goodbye!" cried the genial Scarecrow, waving his hand.
</p><p>
Too stupefied for speech, the assemblage gaped with amazement as the party
floated gently upward. Up&mdash;up&mdash;and out of sight whirled the entire party.

<h3>THE FLIGHT OF THE PARASOL</h3>
<p>
Holding the handle of the parasol, Dorothy steered it with all the skill of
an aviator, and in several minutes after their start the party had entered
the deep, black passage down which the Scarecrow had fallen. Each one of
the adventurers was fastened to the parasol with ropes of different length
so that none of them bumped together, but even with all the care in the
world it was not possible to keep them from bumping the sides of the tube.
The Comfortable Camel grunted plaintively from time to time, and Dorothy
could hear the Doubtful Dromedary complaining bitterly in the darkness. It
was pitch dark, but by keeping one hand in touch with the bean pole,
Dorothy managed to hold the parasol in the center.
</p><p>
"How long will it take?" she called breathlessly to the Scarecrow, who was
dangling just below.
</p><p>
"Hours!" wheezed the Scarecrow, holding fast to his hat. "I hope none of the
parties on this line hear us," he added nervously, thinking of the
Middlings.
</p><p>
"What recks it?" blustered Sir Hokus. "Hast forgotten my trusty sword?" But
his words were completely drowned in the rattle of his armor.
</p><p>
"Hush!" warned the Scarecrow, "Or we'll be pulled in." So for almost an hour,
they flew up the dark, chimney-like tube with only an occasional groan as one
or another scraped against the rough sides of the passage. Then, before they
knew what was happening, the parasol crashed into something, half closed, and
the whole party started to fall head over heels over helmets.
</p><p>
"O!" gasped Dorothy, turning a complete somersault, "catch hold of the bean
pole, somebody!"
</p><p>
"Put up the parasol!" shrieked the Scarecrow. Just then Dorothy, finding
herself right side up, grasped the pole herself and snapped the parasol
wide open. Up, up, up they soared again, faster than ever!
</p><p>
"We're flying up much faster than I fell down. We must be at the top!"
called the Scarecrow hoarsely, "and somebody has closed the opening!"
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/277.jpg" alt="The Scarecrow rejoices"></p>


<br>
<p align="center"><img src="images/279.jpg" alt="Safe!"></p>
<h2><a name="23">CHAPTER 23</a></h2>
<h3>SAFE AT LAST IN THE LAND OF OZ</h3>

<p>
"Must we keep bumping until we bump through?" panted Dorothy anxiously.
</p><p>
"No, by my hilts!" roared Sir Hokus, and setting his foot in a notch of the
beanstalk, he cut with his sword the rope that bound him to the parasol.
"Put the parasol down half way, and I'll climb ahead and cut an opening."
</p><p>
With great difficulty Dorothy partially lowered the parasol, and instantly
their speed diminished. Indeed, they barely moved at all, and the Knight
had soon passed them on his climb to the top.
</p><p>
"Are you there?" rumbled the Cowardly Lion anxiously. A great clod of earth
landed on his head, filling his eyes and mouth with mud.
</p><p>
"Ugh!" roared the lion.
</p><p>
"It's getting light! It's getting light!" screamed Dorothy, and in her
excitement snapped the parasol up.
</p><p>
Sir Hokus, having cut with his sword a large circular hole in the thin crust
of earth covering the tube, was about to step out when the parasol, hurling up
from below, caught him neatly on its top, and out burst the whole party and
sailed up almost to the clouds!
</p><p>
"Welcome to Oz!" cried Dorothy, looking down happily on the dear familiar
Munchkin landscape.
</p><p>
"Home at last!" exulted the Scarecrow, wafting a kiss downward.
</p><p>
"Let's get down to earth before we knock the sun into a cocked hat," gasped
the Cowardly Lion, for Dorothy, in her excitement, had forgotten to lower
the parasol.
</p><p>
Now the little girl lowered the parasol carefully at first, then faster and
faster and finally shut it altogether.
</p><p>
Sir Hokus took a high dive from the top. Down tumbled the others, over and
over. But fortunately for all, there was a great haystack below, and upon
this they landed in a jumbled heap close to the magic bean pole. As it
happened, there was no one in sight. Up they jumped in a trice, and while
the Comfortable Camel and Doubtful Dromedary munched contentedly at the
hay, Sir Hokus and the Scarecrow placed some loose boards over the opening
around the bean pole and covered them with dirt and cornstalks.
</p><p>
"I will get Ozma to close it properly with the Magic Belt," said the
Scarecrow gravely. "It wouldn't do to have people sliding down my family
tree and scaring poor Tappy. As for me, I shall never leave Oz again!"
</p><p>
"I hope not," growled the Cowardly Lion, tenderly examining his scratched hide.
</p><p>
"But if you hadn't, I'd never have had such lovely adventures or found Sir
Hokus and the Comfortable Camel and Doubtful Dromedary," said Dorothy. "And
what a lot I have to tell Ozma! Let's go straight to the Emerald City."
</p><p>
"It's quite a journey," explained the Scarecrow to Sir Hokus, who was
cleaning off his armor with a handful of straw.
</p><p>
"I go where Lady Dot goes," replied the Knight, smiling affectionately at
the little girl and straightening the ragged hair ribbon which he still
wore on his arm.
</p><p>
"Don't forget me, dear Karwan Bashi," wheezed the Comfortable Camel, putting
his head on the Knight's shoulder.
</p><p>
"You're a sentimental dunce, Camy. I doubt whether they'll take us at all!"
The Doubtful Dromedary looked wistfully at Dorothy.
</p><p>
"Go to, now!" cried Sir Hokus, putting an arm around each neck. "You're just
like two of the family!"
</p><p>
"It will be very comfortable to go to now," sighed the camel.
</p><p>
"We're all a big, jolly family here," said the Scarecrow, smiling brightly,
"and Oz is the friendliest country in the world."
</p><p>
"Right," said the Cowardly Lion, "but let's get started!" He stretched his
tired muscles and began limping stiffly toward the yellow brick road.
</p><p>
"Wait," cried Dorothy, "have you forgotten the parasol?"
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/283.jpg" alt="Sir Hokus and the Doubtful Dromedary"></p>
<p>
"I wish I could," groaned the Cowardly Lion, rolling his eyes.
</p><p>
Sir Hokus, with folded arms, was gazing regretfully at the bean pole. "It
has been a brave quest," he sighed, "but now, I take it, our adventures are
over!" Absently, the Knight felt in his boot-top and drawing out a small
red bean popped it into his mouth. Just before reaching the top of the
tube, he had pulled a handful of them from the beanstalk, but the others
had fallen out when he dove into the hay.
</p><p>
"Shall we use the parasol again, Lady Dot?" he asked, still staring pensively
at the bean pole. "Shall&mdash;?"
</p><p>
He got no farther, nor did Dorothy answer his question. Instead, she gave a
loud scream and clutched the Scarecrow's arm. The Scarecrow, taken by
surprise, fell over backward, and the Comfortable Camel, raising his head
inquiringly, gave a bellow of terror. From the Knight's shoulders a green
branch had sprung, and while the company gazed in round-eyed amazement it
stretched toward the bean pole, attached itself firmly, and then shot straight
up into the air, the Knight kicking and struggling on the end. In another
second, he was out of sight.
</p><p>
"Come back! Come back!" screamed the Comfortable Camel, running around
distractedly.
</p><p>
"I doubt we'll ever see him again!" groaned the Doubtful Dromedary, craning
his neck upward.
</p><p>
"Do something! Do something!" begged Dorothy. At which the Scarecrow jumped
up and dashed toward the little farmhouse.
</p><p>
"I'll get an ax," he called over his shoulder, "and chop down the bean pole."
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/285.jpg" alt="Dorothy and the Scarecrow worry"></p>
<p>
"No, don't do that!" roared the Cowardly Lion, starting after him. "Do you
want to break him to pieces?"
</p><p>
"Oh! Oh! Can't you think of something else?" cried Dorothy. "And hurry, or
he'll be up to the moon!"
</p><p>
The Scarecrow put both hands to his head and stared around wildly. Then,
with a triumphant wave of his hat, declared himself ready to act.
</p><p>
"The parasol!" cried the late Emperor of Silver Island. "Quick, Dorothy, put
up the parasol!"
</p><p>
Snatching the parasol, which lay at the foot of the bean pole, Dorothy snapped
it open, and the Scarecrow just had time to make a flying leap and seize the
handle before it soared upward, and in a trice they, too, had disappeared.
</p><p>
"Doubty! Doubty!" wailed the Comfortable Camel, crowding up to his humpbacked
friend, "we're having a pack of trouble. My knees are all a-tremble!"
</p><p>
"Now don't you worry," advised the Cowardly Lion, sitting down resignedly.
"I'm frightened myself, but that's because I'm so cowardly. Queer things
happen in Oz, but they usually turn out all right. Why, Hokus is just
growing up with the country, that's all, just growing up with the country."
</p><p>
"Doubt that," sniffed the Doubtful Dromedary faintly. "He was grown up in
the beginning."
</p><p>
"But think of the Scarecrow's brains. You leave things to the Scarecrow."
But it was no use. Both beasts began to roar dismally.
</p><p>
"I don't want a plant. I want my Karwan Bashi," sobbed the Comfortable Camel
broken-heartedly.
</p><p>
"Well, don't drown me," begged the Cowardly Lion, moving out of the way of
the camel's tears. "Say, what's that draft?"
</p><p>
What indeed? In the trees overhead, a very cyclone whistled, and before the
three had even time to catch their breath, they were blown high into the
air and the next instant were hurtling toward the Emerald City like three
furry cannonballs, faster and faster.
</p><br>
<p align="center"><img src="images/289.jpg" alt="Flying homeward"></p>



<h2><a name="24">CHAPTER 24</a></h2>
<h3>HOMEWARD BOUND TO THE EMERALD CITY</h3>

<p>
Dorothy and the Scarecrow, clinging fast to the magic parasol, had followed
the Knight almost to the clouds. At first, it looked as if they would never
catch up with him, so swiftly was the branch growing, but it was not long
before the little umbrella began to gain, and in several minutes more they
were beside Sir Hokus himself.
</p><p>
"Beshrew me, now!" gasped the Knight, stretching out his hand toward
Dorothy. "Can'st stop this reckless plant?"
</p><p>
"Give me your sword," commanded the Scarecrow, "and I'll cut you off."
</p><p>
Dorothy, with great difficulty, kept the parasol close to the Knight while
the Scarecrow reached for the sword. But Sir Hokus backed away in alarm.
</p><p>
"'Tis part of me, an' you cut it off, I will be cut off, too. 'Tis rooted in
my back," he puffed.
</p><p>
"What shall we do?" cried Dorothy in distress. "Maybe if we take hold of his
hands we can keep him from going any higher."
</p><p>
The Scarecrow, jamming down his hat so it wouldn't blow off, nodded
approvingly, and each holding the parasol with one hand gave the other to the
Knight. And when Dorothy pointed the parasol down, to her great delight Sir
Hokus came also, the thin green branch growing just about as fast as they
moved.
</p><p>
Just then the little fan, which had been rolling around merrily in Dorothy's
pocket, slipped out and fell straight down toward the three unsuspecting
beasts below. Draft! No wonder!
</p><p>
But Dorothy never missed it, and quite unconscious of such a calamity
anxiously talked over the Knight's predicament with the Scarecrow. They both
decided that the best plan was to fly straight to the Emerald City and have
Ozma release the Knight from the enchanted beanstalk.
</p><p>
"I'm sorry you got tangled up in my family tree, old fellow," said the
Scarecrow after they had flown some time in silence, "but this makes us
relations, doesn't it?" He winked broadly at the Knight.
</p><p>
"So it does," said Sir Hokus jovially. "I'm a branch of your family now. Yet
methinks I should not have swallowed that bean."
</p><p>
"Bean?" questioned Dorothy. "What bean?" The Knight carefully explained how
he had plucked a handful of red beans from the beanstalk just before
reaching the top of the tube and how he had eaten one.
</p><p>
"So that's what started you growing!" exclaimed Dorothy in surprise.
</p><p>
"Alas, yes!" admitted the Knight. "I've never felt more grown-up in my
life," he finished solemnly. "An adventurous country, this Oz!"
</p><p>
"I should say it was," chuckled the Scarecrow. "But isn't it almost time we
were reaching the Emerald City, Dorothy?"
</p><p>
"I think I'm going in the right direction," answered the little girl, "but
I'll fly a little lower to be sure."
</p><p>
"Not too fast! Not too fast!" warned Sir Hokus, looking nervously over his
shoulder at his long, wriggling stem.
</p><p>
"There's Ozma's palace!" cried the Scarecrow all at once.
</p><p>
"And there's Ozma!" screamed Dorothy, peering down delightedly. "And Scraps
and Tik-Tok and everybody!"
</p><p>
She pointed the parasol straight down, when a sharp tug from Sir Hokus jerked
them all back. They were going faster than the poor Knight was growing, so
Dorothy lowered the parasol half way, and slowly they floated toward the
earth, landing gently in one of the flower beds of Ozma's lovely garden.
</p><p>
"Come along and meet the folks," said the Scarecrow as Dorothy closed the
parasol. But Sir Hokus clutched him in alarm.
</p><p>
"Hold! Hold!" gasped the Knight. "I've stopped growing, but if you leave me
I'll shoot up into the air again."
</p><p>
The Scarecrow and Dorothy looked at each other in dismay. Sure enough, the
Knight had stopped growing, and it was all they could do to hold him down to
earth, for the stubborn branch of beanstalk was trying to straighten up. They
had fallen quite a distance from the palace itself, and all the people of Oz
had their backs turned, so had not seen their singular arrival.
</p><p>
"Hello!" called the Scarecrow loudly. Then "Help! Help!" as the Knight
jerked him twice into the air. But Ozma, Trot, Jack Pumpkinhead and all the
rest were staring upward and talking so busily among themselves that they
did not hear either Dorothy's or the Scarecrow's cries. First one, then the
other was snatched off his feet, and although Sir Hokus, with tears in his
eyes, begged them to leave him to his fate, they held on with all their
might. Just as it looked as if they all three would fly into the air again,
the little Wizard of Oz happened to turn around.
</p><p>
"Look! Look!" he cried, tugging Ozma's sleeve.
</p><p>
"Why, it's Dorothy!" gasped Ozma, rubbing her eyes. "It's Dorothy and&mdash;"
</p><p>
"Help! Help!" screamed the Scarecrow, waving one arm wildly. Without waiting
another second, all the celebrities of Oz came running toward the three
adventurers.
</p><p align="center"><img src="images/293.jpg" alt="Waving one arm wildly">
</p><p>
"Somebody heavy come take hold!" puffed Dorothy, out of breath with her
efforts to keep Sir Hokus on the ground.
</p><p>
The Ozites, seeing that help was needed at once, suppressed their curiosity.
</p><p>
"I'm heavy," said Tik-Tok solemnly, clasping the Knight's arm. The Tin Woodman
seized his other hand, and Dorothy sank down exhausted on the grass.
</p><p>
Princess Ozma pressed forward.
</p><p>
"What does it all mean? Where did you come from?" asked the little Queen of
Oz, staring in amazement at the strange spectacle before her.
</p><p>
"And who is this medieval person?" asked Professor Wogglebug, pushing
forward importantly. (He had returned to the palace to collect more data
for the Royal Book of Oz.)
</p><p>
"He doesn't look evil to me," giggled Scraps, dancing up to Sir Hokus, her
suspender button eyes snapping with fun.
</p><p>
"He isn't," said Dorothy indignantly, for Sir Hokus was too shaken about to
answer. "He's my Knight Errant."
</p><p>
"Ah, I see," replied Professor Wogglebug. "A case of 'When Knighthood was in
flower.'" And would you believe it&mdash;the beanstalk at that minute burst into
a perfect shower of red blossoms that came tumbling down over everyone. Before
they had recovered from their surprise, the branch snapped off close to the
Knight's armor, and Tik-Tok, the Tin Woodman and Sir Hokus rolled over in a
heap. The branch itself whistled through the air and disappeared.
</p><p>
"Oh," cried Dorothy, hugging the Knight impulsively, "I'm so glad."
</p><p>
"Are you all right?" asked the Scarecrow anxiously.
</p><p>
"Good as ever!" announced Sir Hokus, and indeed all traces of the magic
stalk had disappeared from his shoulders.
</p><p>
"Dorothy!" cried Ozma again. "What does it all mean?"
</p><p>
"Merely that I slid down my family tree and that Dorothy and this Knight
rescued me," said the Scarecrow calmly.
</p><p>
"And he's a real Royalty&mdash;so there!" cried Dorothy with a wave at the
Scarecrow and making a little face at Professor Wogglebug. "Meet his
Supreme Highness, Chang Wang Woe of Silver Island, who had abdicated his
throne and returned to be a plain Scarecrow in Oz!"
</p><p>
Then, as the eminent Educator of Oz stood gaping at the Scarecrow, "Oh, Ozma,
I've so much to tell you!"
</p><p>
"Begin! Begin!" cried the little Wizard. "For everything's mighty
mysterious. First, the Cowardly Lion and two unknown beasts shoot through
the air and stop just outside the third-story windows, and there they hang
although I've tried all my magic to get them down. Then you and the
Scarecrow drop in with a strange Knight!"
</p><p>
"Oh, the poor Cowardly Lion!" gasped Dorothy as the Wizard finished
speaking. "The magic fan!" She felt hurriedly in her pocket. "It's gone!"
</p><p>
"It must have slipped out of your pocket and blown them here, and they'll
never come down till that fan is closed," cried the Scarecrow in an
agitated voice.
</p><p>
All of this was Greek to Ozma and the others, but when Dorothy begged the
little Queen to send for her Magic Belt, she did it without question. This
belt Dorothy had captured from the Gnome King, and it enabled the wearer to
wish people and objects wherever one wanted them.
</p><p>
"I wish the magic fan to close and to come safely back to me," said Dorothy
as soon as she had clasped the belt around her waist. No sooner were the
words out before there was a loud crash and a series of roars and groans.
Everybody started on a run for the palace, Sir Hokus ahead of all the rest.
The fan had mysteriously returned to Dorothy's pocket.
</p><p>
The three animals had fallen into a huge cluster of rose bushes and, though
badly scratched and frightened, were really unhurt.
</p><p>
"I doubt that I'll like Oz," quavered the Doubtful Dromedary, lurching toward
Sir Hokus.
</p><p>
"You might have been more careful of that fan," growled the Cowardly Lion
reproachfully, plucking thorns from his hide. The Comfortable Camel was so
overjoyed to see the Knight that he rested his head on Sir Hokus's shoulder
and began weeping down his armor.
</p><p>
And now that their adventures seemed really over, what explanations were to
be made! Sitting on the top step of the palace with all of them around her,
Dorothy told the whole wonderful story of the Scarecrow's family tree. When
her breath gave out, the Scarecrow took up the tale himself, and as they
all realized how nearly they had lost their jolly comrade, many of the
party shed real tears. Indeed, Nick Chopper hugged the Scarecrow till there
was not a whole straw in his body.
</p><p>
"Never leave us again," begged Ozma, and the Scarecrow, crossing Nick
Chopper's heart (he had none of his own), promised that he never would.
</p><p>
And what a welcome they gave Sir Hokus, the Doubtful Dromedary and the
Comfortable Camel! Only Professor Wogglebug seemed disturbed. During the
strange recital, he had grown quieter and quieter and finally, with an
embarrassed cough, had excused himself and hurried into the palace.
</p><p>
He went directly to the study, and seating himself at a desk opened a large
book, none other than <i>The Royal Book of Oz</i>. Dipping an emerald pen in the
ink, he began a new chapter headed thus:
</p><p align="center">
    HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY, THE SCARECROW</p>
<p align="center">
  Late Emperor and Imperial Sovereign of<br>
              Silver Island</p>
<p>
Then, flipping over several pages to a chapter headed "Princess Dorothy!", he
wrote carefully at the end, "Dorothy, Princess and Royal Discoverer of Oz."
</p><p>
Meanwhile, below stairs, the Scarecrow was distributing his gifts. There
were silver chains for everyone in the palace and shining silver slippers
for Ozma, Betsy Bobbin, Trot and Dorothy, and a bottle of silver polish for
Nick Chopper.
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/299.jpg" alt="Silver polish for Nick Chopper"></p>
<p>
Dorothy presented Ozma with the magic fan and parasol, and they were safely
put away by Jellia Jamb with the other magic treasures of Oz.
</p><p>
Next, because they were all curious to see the Scarecrow's wonderful
Kingdom, they hurried upstairs to look in the Magic Picture.
</p><p>
"Show us the Emperor of Silver Island," commanded Ozma. Immediately the
beautiful silver throne room appeared. Happy Toko had removed his imperial hat
and was standing on his head to the great delight of the whole court, and a
host of little Silver Islander boys were peeking in at the windows.
</p><p>
"Now doesn't that look cheerful?" asked the Scarecrow delightedly. "I knew
he'd make a good Emperor."
</p><p>
"I wish we would hear what he's saying," said Dorothy. "Oh, do look at Chew
Chew!" The Grand Chew Chew was standing beside the throne scowling horribly.
</p><p>
"I think I can arrange for you to hear," muttered the Wizard of Oz, and
taking a queer magic instrument from his pocket, he whispered "Aohbeeobbuy."
</p><p>
Instantly they heard the jolly voice of Happy Toko singing:
</p><p class="poetry">
    Oh shine his shoes of silver,<br>
    And brush his silver queue,<br>
    For I am but an Emperor<br>
    And he's the Grand Chew Chew!
</p><p>
Ozma laughed heartily as the picture faded away, and so did the others.
Indeed, there was so much to ask and wonder about that it seemed as if they
never would finish talking.
</p><p>
"Let's have a party&mdash;an old-fashioned Oz party," proposed Ozma when the
excitement had calmed down a bit. And an old-fashioned party it was, with
places for everybody and a special table for the Cowardly Lion, the Hungry
Tiger, Toto, the Glass Cat, the Comfortable Camel, the Doubtful Dromedary
and all the other dear creatures of that amazing Kingdom.
</p><p>
Sir Hokus insisted upon stirring up a huge pasty for the occasion, and there
were songs, speeches and cheers for everyone, not forgetting the Doubtful
Dromedary.
</p><p>
At the cheering he rose with an embarrassed jerk of his long neck. "In my
left-hand saddle-sack," he said gruffly, "there is a quantity of silken
shawls and jewels. I doubt whether they are good enough, but I would like
Dorothy and Queen Ozma to have them."
</p><p>
"Hear! Hear!" cried the Scarecrow, pounding on the table with his knife.
Then everything grew quiet as Ozma told how she, with the help of Glinda,
the Good Sorceress, had stopped the war between the Horners and Hoppers.
</p><p>
When she had finished, Sir Hokus sprang up impulsively. "I prithee, lovely
Lady, never trouble your royal head about wars again. From now on, I will
do battle for you and little Dorothy and Oz, and <i>I</i> will be your good
Knight every day." At this, the applause was tremendous.
</p><p class="poetry">
    Ye good Knight of Oz, full of courage and vim,<br>
    Will do battle for us, and we'll take care of him!
</p><p>
shouted Scraps, who was becoming more excited every minute.
</p><p>
"I'll lend you some of my polish for your armor, old fellow," said Nick
Chopper as the Knight sat down, beaming with pleasure.
</p><p>
"Well," said Ozma with a smile when everyone had feasted and talked to
heart's content, "is everybody happy?"
</p><p>
"I am!" cried the Comfortable Camel. "For here I am perfectly comfortable."
</p><p>
"I am!" cried Dorothy, putting her arm around the Scarecrow, who sat next to
her. "For I have found my old friend and made some new ones."
</p><p>
"I'm happy!" cried the Scarecrow, waving his glass, "because there is no age
in Oz, and I am still my old Ozish self."
</p><p>
"As for me," said the Knight, "I am happy, for I have served a Lady, gone on
a Quest, and <i>Slain a Dragon! Ozma, and Oz forever!</i>
</p>
